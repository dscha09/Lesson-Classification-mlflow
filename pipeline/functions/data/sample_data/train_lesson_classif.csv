0,"The EIRR was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test different scenarios of O&M costs and benefits. The sensitivity analysis results indicated that the project continued to be economically viable for all tested scenarios. If a 20% maintenance cost increase would be combined with a 20% benefit reduction, the EIRR would be still 15.6% for the whole project. The sensitivity analysis confirmed that the project has robust economic viability. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the EIRR was more sensitive to changes in economic benefits. For this reason, the expressway operator needs to keep the project expressway in good condition and facilitate the fast-growing traffic, especially the through traffic. The local government should pay attention to the socioeconomic development of the project area, foster local transport services, and increase incomes for the expressway users. The results of the sensitivity analysis are in the following table.

1,"The efforts of the NCRPB in revisiting its regional plan and the growing demand in the region, also promoted by central government schemes such as the Smart Cities Mission, offer an excellent opportunity for the NCRPB to scale up its support to new initiatives while complementing urban development needs. The NCRPB will need to continue its transformation toward a full- fledged financial intermediary, offering a variety of project development and  loan  products (e.g., interest rate regime), enhancing its leverage and marketing. Important recommendations are:"
0,"Environmental Impact. ADB assisted the government in conducting an EIA. The draft EIA report was discussed with stakeholders and disclosed to the public in November 2010. The impacts during construction were mostly temporary and reversible, and hazardous materials spills were avoided. Potential impacts during operations were expected to be greater and pollutants entering the Chatyr-Kul Lake aquatic ecosystem could accumulate because the lake has no outlet. Long-term impacts caused by increased traffic, vehicle emissions, and possible hazardous materials spills posed potential risks to the Chatyr-Kul Lake ecosystem, and the project undertook mitigation measures, including physical facilities to address potential spills. An environmental monitoring program was in place and implemented by the contractor and the supervision consultants. During implementation, the contractor and supervision consultant complied with the environmental safeguard requirements and carried out regular environmental impact surveys and monitoring (described in paras. 25-26)."
1,"Lesson 1: Linking livelihoods to business. The lack of development assets for rural smallholders was a significant constraint for land users, hindering adoption of sustainable land management. Monitoring results suggested that smallholders with links to market chains and processors were accumulating assets faster. Under the project, the NARB played a critical role as a dragon-head enterprise. It supported various businesses, covering halal meat processing, dairy, and wineries, each supported by several farms. Under supply contracts, smallholders were directed to value added businesses. The project improved rural livelihoods significantly. Growth in commercial enterprises relied on local labor for implementation activities, which provided significant short-run benefits. Livelihood activities not directly linked to commercial enterprises occur but with lower returns due to market risks and the lack of connection to value added benefits. The average per capita income of project beneficiary households increased by 175% from 2009 to 2015, compared with 160% for the control groups, without the project."
0,"This project implementation structure was planned on the assumption that the PIC contract would be in place for the duration of the project. When this did not occur, a number of planned project implementation activities did not continue and additional resources were required. The PIC resources could have been better coordinated and utilized given the delays with linked project activities. The PIC contract closed in September 2011, before civil works started. This was due to the lengthy delays in project implementation and the extensions in closing date. After the closing of the PIC contract, the project had to recruit individual consultants for a PMU in the DNSA, which operated from October 2011 to August 2015. The PMU functioned satisfactorily."
0,"The Emergency Food Assistance Project- Additional Financing (the additional financing) was implemented in one hundred (100) communes in 10 target provinces (Kampong Cham1, Kampong Speu, Kampong Thom, Takeo, Svay Rieng, Prey Veng, Banteay Meanchey, Otdar Meanchey, Preah Vihear and Siem Reap), and covered about 55,323 ID poor (poorest of the poor) direct beneficiary households. The impact of the project was to be reduced vulnerability of food-insecure households in the target provinces and the outcome was to be improved access to sufficient and nutritious food by food insecure households. The outputs of the project were: (i) Increased availability to and awareness of nutritious food and hygiene among the food-insecure households; (ii) Increased access to improved agricultural inputs and technologies among food- insecure farmers and women; (iii) Improved capacity to mainstream to food security; and (iv) Effective project implementation and management."
0,"The targets ensuring the financial sustainability of the power companies could not be achieved; however, financial losses were reduced to ₹210 million for 2017 financial year from ₹2.7 billion in 2005, and dependence on state support was reduced to 20% from 30% as 29 The 19% total losses estimated at appraisal was an optimistic target since it was based on losses achieved by the best performing distribution utilities in India and was not in line with the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (MPERC) own projection in 2012. In 2009 to 2016, distribution losses registered from 41.58% to 25.13% for DISCOM-C, 37.23% to 22.50% for DISCOM-E and 35.5% to 22.58% for DISCOM-W. considered during FFA. While the FFA did not provide specific targets for overall distribution system operational improvements, the completion of the facility and especially project 6 have improved system reliability (i.e., 60% reduction in power interruptions and tripping at transformer stations, as recorded at all feeder lines), and customer complaints have been reduced by half.30 Similarly, the duration of such interruptions in 11 kV feeders has been reduced by 25% and by 51% in 33 kV feeders. The rural power supply increased from 4 to 10 hours per day, while the urban supply increased from 12 to 24 hours per day."

1,"Implementing agencies. A project design with multiple components needs to carefully choose implementing agencies that are equipped to undertake specific responsibilities from the beginning. For example, the inclusion of the DOC as the implementing agency for the trade- facilitation component and the clear delineation of responsibility for road safety to the DOR from the beginning of the project could have minimized implementation delays. Delegation of authority for transport management, including vehicle overloading, to the DOTM could also have been done earlier."
1,"Executing agency set up effective organization and procedures to ensure adequate guidance from management and proper monitoring of field implementation. On-the-job training also helped project staff fully understand PRC and ADB requirements for the project implementation and improved staff project management skills. PMO and relevant project management authorities effectively supervised, monitored, and controlled costs of project implementation. The PMO and relevant project management authorities intensified project implementation supervision for each of subprojects to identify and address the issues and difficulties during the implementation in a timely manner to keep project implementation on schedule."

Details are summarized in Table A8.6, over. The total number of female farmers including from non-female headed households who participated in the subsidized sales of quality seeds and fertilizers were 23,988. The sold inputs were used to cultivate around 31,326 hectares of agriculture land. An independent monitor (the NGO CEDAC) recruited to oversee monitoring of subsidized sale of quality seed and fertilizer, and subsequent complaint resolution (if any) observed all the four subsidized sales."
0,"In estimating the sub-zone economic costs and benefits, as outlined above the sub- project economic costs are the actual capital investment and O&M costs are estimates as no data is available. For the economic benefits with the sub-zone non-incremental and incremental water volumes, these are estimated based on the number of incremental households and the incremental benefits to existing households. Given the poor system operation and performance and the very limited project monitoring and performance data, estimates had to be made on the incremental service to new household connections these are estimated at 50 percent of household water requirements and for the existing households that the incremental benefits are"

0,"Low water availability across the province was well identified at appraisal and will continue until new Indus Basin water storages are increased. However, PID notifies or posts on its website updated channel information for head and tail discharges, water availability forecast with every 10-day canal withdrawal plan for a cropping season and actual withdrawals, and water rotational plan for distributaries and minors. It is likely that the outcome related to water delivery at outlets will be achieved with continued support and monitoring. The groundwater management component was delivered and the on-farm water management component completed, except for a few pilot demonstration technologies, which were later scaled up by the government in project command areas (para. 17). Envisaged institutional changes encountered challenges. Farmers organizations completed one tenure, from 2012 to 2015, which is a limited time for management change in a new and low-capacity environment. Generally, the transition period between successive farmers’ organizations remained longer across five area water boards (AWBs) in"
0,"The project benefits were in part based on restructuring DNSA into an independent water utility. This later became part of ADB’s strategy for water infrastructure for 2006–2010. This restructuring was not undertaken during the project period. In the early stages of the project, ADB missions documented in review reports that they had recommended to the government the preparation of a road map as an initial step for this reform process, but there were no defined actions. In the late stages of the project, the government undertook some initial study on public–private partnership options. During the project completion review (PCR) mission, ADB had initiated discussions with the government on a water supply and sanitation investment plan, policies, and institutional reform for 2018–2030."

1,"The project promoted joint cross-border activities among border districts. This included weekly cross-border CDC information exchange at checkpoints and border districts, simulation exercises, and joint workshops and training. Despite good efforts, the target of two or more cross- border activities per year was only substantially achieved given the complexities of organizing joint activities in border districts. Through additional financing, Cambodia and Viet Nam were able to reach targets on cross-border activities focusing on malaria, including malaria management among the mobile population in border areas. In the Lao PDR, only half of the project border districts participated in joint activities."

1,"The project also has efforts to promote gender equality in development of partnership with private sectors. The increase in gender awareness of employers contributed to reducing gender stereotypes and discrimination against females who are graduated from technical fields. The social and gender equity issues were incorporated into the material of the training workshops on planning and marketing to develop a strategy to strengthen linkages between vocational colleges and enterprises. Gender equality issues were also included in discussions between vocational colleges with industry and enterprises to identify employment opportunities for female students from non-traditional occupations and understand about priority of employers to recruit female workers. As a result, vocational colleges also established the job introduction mechanism to introduce graduated female students to local enterprises. Some vocational colleges signed an agreement with local enterprises to guarantee employment opportunities for female students of the technology industry."
0,"The project is rated effective. Water delivery capacity of the upgraded LBDC was improved to the sanctioned discharge. The Balloki Barrage was upgraded to enhance flood passage. Diversion from barrage to the Balloki–Sulemanki Link was enhanced to sanctioned flows, and major R&U of the distribution system was completed (paras. 6–8). This constitutes main outputs and project investments. The groundwater management component was delivered and the on- farm water management component was completed except for a few pilot technology- demonstration activities, which were later scaled up by the Government of Punjab in project command areas (paras. 12-13). The PIAPPF design change enabled the preparation of more than $1.7 billion worth of projects, which reinforces the commitment of ADB and the government to better planning and project readiness. The LBDC operated at the maximum available diversions. Its command area received 100% of water supplies against entitlements for kharif in 2017 and 89% for rabi in 2017–2018, and received 15% higher flows compared to the previous 5-years average for June–October. A major PID hydraulic performance indicator is the relative delivery performance ratio, which showed improvement in tail reaches (para. 9). Low province- wide water availability was identified at appraisal and will continue until the Indus Basin water storages are increased. However, the PID posts updated channel information on its website, including head and tail discharges, water availability forecasts showing a 10-day canal withdrawal plan during cropping seasons as well as actual withdrawals, and a rotational plan for  distributary and minor canals.24 20 ADB. 2008.

0,"The design used proven project implementation arrangements. MARD was the executing agency, and its experienced central project office (CPO) was tasked with implementing the project through a central project management unit (CPMU) and provincial project management units (PPMUs). Irrigation management companies (IMCs)—the eventual owners and operators of the constructed schemes—were consulted during the feasibility study and detailed engineering design (DED) preparation. Also, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system used was based on MARD’s survey of the BHH’s immediate needs and was within the capacity of IMCs responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M)."
1,"The strong commitment of ADB, the HPG, and the PRC government to systematically improving air quality in the BTL region made the delivery of the first PBL in the PRC feasible. The HPG sustained its political commitment throughout the program and offered support to implement the policy reforms. ADB quickly mobilized resources and coordinated with other development agencies to process and implement the program. ADB has also committed to offering long-term financial assistance to help the HPG continue to improve air quality in the BTH region. For 2016– 2020, ADB is making $500 million in loans available annually to the Government of the PRC to support air quality improvement in the BTH region."

0,"Investment component. At appraisal, the project envisaged the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 1,080 km of state highways identified under the state road rehabilitation program.7 During project preparation, the candidate roads were reviewed and selected according to the selection criteria and the approval process specified in the project appraisal documents. Upon completion, 15 sections of state highways, totaling 1,083.1 km, were rehabilitated or reconstructed. This involved widening and strengthening the roads from single or intermediate- lane roads to intermediate or two-lane standards with bituminous pavement. Overall, 149 bridges and 1,330 culverts were rehabilitated, and road signage and furniture provided. Compensatory reforestation of 1:15.7 was achieved against the targeted 1:7. 8 A road accident emergency response system was developed and became operational in June 2015. A summary of the outputs of the investment component is in Appendix 2."
1,"Design and monitoring framework. Some of the expected performance targets and  indicators formulated in the DMF were aligned more with the overall investment program, and a  separate DMF for the project was not prepared. Apart from the DMF for the MFF, a DMF should  be prepared for each tranche under the MFF, which should be distinct, specific, and directly  attributable to the respective tranche so that its achievement against the project-specific  indicators and targets can be suitably evaluated."
1,"The gender mainstreaming module, which covers gender sensitive knowledge and practical guidance to promote girls’ participation in the non-traditional occupations was also incorporated in the development training programs provided by this project. For example, training on management and leadership skills; training on planning and social marketing; training on program accreditation – assessor. However, the project experience showed that besides gender mainstreaming into training materials, it really needs to have gender awareness training session to ensure that the school leaders and teachers have a clear understanding of gender concepts and why gender important to them. Especially, the project also needs to build school leadership in addressing gender issues."
1,"Performance of contractors and implementation delays. One of the primary reasons for the implementation delays was the limited experience and capacity of small local contractors, who were considered as subcontractors. This inevitably affected the project performance. The contract for package 5 was terminated and a new contract was procured for the balance of work, causing further implementation delays. The project was one of the first ADB-financed expressways for the VEC. Thus, VEC experienced a learning period for ADB’s procurement process and loan administration policy. After implementing this project, VEC’s capacity to implement future ADB-financed projects is expected to improve."
1,"The CLV governments are highly committed to collaboratively controlling and preventing communicable diseases and ensuring regional health security. 5 An agreed common strategy is to collectively seek compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 core capacities, and to jointly implement the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED)6 3 Cambodia received a grant of $10 million, the Lao PDR received a grant of $12 million, and Viet Nam received a loan of $27 million. Counterpart funds contributed by the governments were $1 million each from Cambodia and the Lao PDR, and $3 million from Viet Nam. 4 Additional financing to fight malaria is financed through the Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund (RMTF). Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. 5 Their commitments were voiced at high-level political events such as the GMS Summit of Leaders; and the November 2018 meeting of Association of Southeast Asian Nations representatives in Bali: ASEAN Health Ministers renew commitment to fight communicable and emerging infectious diseases. 6 The IHR 2005, a global framework endorsed by the 58th World Health Assembly, provide a legal instrument intended to identify core minimum capacities that need to be implemented nationally; World Health Organization (WHO). Asia- Pacific strategy for emerging diseases (APSED). and the World Health Organization (WHO) malaria elimination strategy for the GMS. 7 Each country adopted health sector strategies and action plans with CDC as a priority (i.e., Cambodia’s Second Health Strategic Plan 2008–2015; the Lao PDR’s National Strategy on Emerging Infectious Diseases 2006–2010; and Viet Nam’s Law on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases enacted in 2008). The design of the project was aligned with these international commitments and national strategies and policies."
1,"Encroachment within the project's road right-of-way has reached serious proportions,  and countermeasures are urgently needed. An innovative approach was pilot-tested on contract  6 of the road improvement component. There a combination of bus lanes and grade-separation  was used at Chiringa Market to keep traders off the road and prevent buses from stopping on  the carriageway. This appears to be working very well, and is recommended for adoption in  similar circumstances on future ADB-assisted projects."

0,"The customer satisfaction, as measured by the number of complaints per thousand customers, improved during the project implementation. However, the number of complaints may not be an accurate measure of performance, as it is a manual system that involves a very lengthy response time, and customers are aware they are unlikely to get a reply and action to a malfunctioning water problem and on this basis take no action. No data or survey collection was undertaken on the benefit to women from the improved water supply services, so this impact indicator could not be measured."
0,"Component 4 was implemented through the Agriculture Department with one director and seven deputy water management officers from 2010 until completion in December 2012. For component 5, a program management office was established in 2010 under the PMU. It was headed by a program director with three regional support offices. The office was closed in 2013 before the PIDA took control. The PIAPPF administration shifted multiple times initially from the IPPMU to the PMO Barrages in 2011, the PMU in 2013, the PMO Barrages in 2015, and the PMU in 2015 where it remained until completion. A project steering committee was established for implementation of the technical assistance, the MFF and the project. The committee could hold only two meetings during the project period, however, ADB missions met members of the committee during missions as requested and the PMU sent monthly progress reports to the Planning and Development Department headed by the committee chairman."

0,"Performance, key problems, and opportunities in the road subsector in Madhya Pradesh were well analyzed. Lessons from previous projects, especially previous state highway projects in Madhya Pradesh, were incorporated in the project. The DMF was sound and indicators were logical and appropriate. Performance targets for outcome and outputs were objective, realistic and measurable. Nonetheless, the DMF could have been improved with inclusion of indicators on sustainability and private sector participation. An engineering design was prepared to minimize social and environmental impacts and to adopt the “green highway” approach. Adequate consultations with stakeholders, particularly with women, contributed significantly to project formulation. Advance actions were taken to ensure that the construction could start without unnecessary delay. All the preparatory activities for the project outputs were completed during project appraisal. In addition, capacity development TA was attached to the project to support the MPRDC’s initiatives related to road safety management. The TA helped MPRDC put the road accident emergency response system into operation and enhanced MPRDC’s road safety capacity through training (para. 7)."

0,"A financial analysis is conducted based on estimates on with-project raw water sales (Table 6), raw water tariff (Table 7), and O&M estimate (paras. 13-15). As stated, historically WTC raw water tariff is less than 35% of O&M costs. Although tariffs have increased in subsequent years, the data indicates that they are still insufficient to recoup O&E costs, let alone of the initial capital investment costs.8 In this instance, FIRR which will be a negative figure is not a meaningful metrics for financial analysis. A more appropriate measure would be the OER, which expresses operating costs as a percentage of operating revenue, and measures to what extent an entity is self-sustainable. An OER less than unity indicates that the project can generate more operating revenues than operating costs."

Despite this, significant disparities in access to health services and health status continue to be observed across geographic regions and population subgroups. In 2005, the government set out an ambitious plan to improve the equity and efficiency of the health sector and the quality of health care at all levels.1 Priority areas for policy development and investment were identified, including (i) strengthening the management of health human resources (HHR); (ii) implementing heath workforce registration and health facility licensing; (iii) enhancing the quality of health workforce training; (iv) strengthening the systems for health service quality management; and (v) improving the efficiency of hospital financing. The government and the Ministry of Health (MOH), in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), determined that a sector development program (SDP) was the most appropriate financing modality to achieve the envisioned reforms. The SDP comprised of (i) a policy-based loan (PBL) that would establish the required policy and regulatory frameworks to operationalize key reform areas, including passing the Law on Examination and Treatment, 2009 (LET); and (ii) a project loan and grant, which would provide the stimulus to translate the reform agenda into tangible results."

With respect to project 6, the DMF was developed after the gaps from the first five projects had been identified, including extension of the improvements to the distribution system in a remote rural district in DISCOM-C as well enterprise resource  planning (ERP), GIS and related computer hardware, and software to automate the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the newly improved distribution systems. It also included an ERP for the MPPMCL to facilitate its role as a power management administrator for the DISCOMs. The DMF for project 6 (Appendix 2) details the specific components and works that were achieved with some adjustment of works based on ground realities (para. 15). Project 6, being the project that completes the facility, has components that helped improve the operation and management of the new works under the facility.

1,"Second, the MFF should have better anticipated and mitigated the cumbersome disbursement and procurement procedures and the complexity and time demands of equitization. The MFF has a maximum implementation period of 10 years. Although the government closed the project after 8 years, the full 10 years would have still been insufficient. Equitization procedures were untested and took longer than expected. Moreover, consultancy packages were not procured in parallel, and the procurement had to satisfy both the national and ADB regulations. In the case of tranche 2, which was effective for less than 2 years (para.33), there was only time to procure and implement a single package."

For Loan A, enrollment has increased in the public vocational colleges as a result of the project’s support for modern equipment, upskilled teachers, and improved capacity to work with industry. The project has succeeded in changing the attitudes of enterprises towards vocational colleges and increased their demand for (i) services, collaboration, and student internships; and (ii) short-term and specific trainings from the vocational colleges. All these contribute to increased revenues for the vocational colleges, which will help them sustain their programs and maintain equipment. Numerical analysis of the projected financial performance of vocational colleges for the next 5 years is presented in Appendix 10."

0,"At appraisal, WTC’s raw water tariff was less than 35% of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Although tariffs have increased in subsequent years, the data indicates that they are still insufficient to recover the O&M costs. A more appropriate measure would be the operating expense ratio, which expresses operating costs as a percentage of operating revenue, and measures to what extent an entity is self-sustainable. The average operating expense ratio is 1.38, reduced from the 2008 level of around 2.86 but is still greater than unity, indicating that WTC’s operating costs is greater than operating revenue. Unless tariffs can be adjusted periodically, WTC operator as a state-owned enterprise would continue to rely on government budgetary support to cover the operating shortfall. Details of the economic and financial analysis are in Appendix 9."

0,"Overall, the MFF and the project 3 are rated successful. The MFF, including project 3, was relevant to the government’s overall development objectives and ADB’s policies at appraisal, and continues to remain so upon completion. The strength of the MFF and project 3 was their objective of universal coverage of water supply and wastewater services. The MFF and project 3 are rated effective, as planned outcome and output targets of the project investments were achieved, except that of SWM. The project 3 is rated efficient, as the EIRR for all interventions was reassessed to be higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The MFF is rated efficient as all of its three tranches are rated efficient. 38 The MFF and project 3 are rated likely sustainable as the O&M costs of MFF assets are met by the GOR as per the assurances and covenants, through statutory transfers from SFC and the CFC, and collection of municipal taxes and user charges. The development impacts are rated satisfactory, as the MFF and project 3 have contributed significantly to all the impact indicators, resulting in improved quality of life indices, poverty reduction, and economic and social inclusion in the 15 ULBs. The performance of the borrower and the executing agency as well as ADB under the MFF and the project 3 are rated satisfactory. These are summarized in the following table. 38 ADB. 2017.

It is important that ADB and the government establish a joint oversight mechanism and introduce a mechanism for coordination between government counterparts and the consulting team."
0,"The program is rated effective. The outputs of the three investment projects were broadly achieved (paras. 9–21). The program upgraded two major canals, LBDC and Pakpattan Canal, which operated at more than 95% of design discharge in 2017, confirming barrage diversions, offtake, and canal conveyance capacity (para. 13). The command area of the Balloki, New Khanki, and Suleimanki barrages received 90% and above water supplies against entitlements for kharif and rabi 2017–2018. The program upgraded distributary and minors in the LBDC and the DPR in kharif in tail reaches have increased from 0.81 in 2006 to 0.95 in 2017 and the relative DPR from 0.94 to 1. In 2016 and 2017, water deliveries in June to October to the LBDC command area increased by an average 15% compared to the 5-year average during the same period in 2011– 2015. The Balloki Barrage’s flood discharge capacity was increased from a 20-year probable flood and the Khanki Barrage from a 50-year probable flood to 1 in 100 years. The upgrade and rehabilitation constituted the main outputs of the approved program investments. Due to time and financing constraints, ADB and government decided to finance Trimmu and Panjnad barrages as stand-alone projects (paras.9,15, and 25). Islam Barrage is proposed as a pipeline project (para. 15). Project 3 was effective as most of the outputs were achieved with rationalized scope for the Pakpattan Canal and improved design for the Suleimanki Barrage (para. 13). Leakages from the Suleimanki barrage were eliminated and the Pakpattan Canal operated at the maximum discharge of 96% (para. 13). PID management capacity improved through training."

0,"During the project, six reallocations of project funds were approved to reflect the  required funding changes outlined in paras. 17–20. There were also approved changes in the percentages of disbursement financing between ADB and the government. This was required given the reallocation affecting the 80/20 balance between ADB and the government. As a result, the uncontracted balance for works (ADB 62%) and equipment (ADB 88%) of approximately $1.717 million of ADB funds were canceled (approved 19 November 2013) with a transfer of $0.923 million into a new civil works category with a lower ADB percentage of 52% to ensure the required balance was maintained. The remainder of this canceled amount plus most of ADB’s unallocated funds were used for incremental funding of project management consulting services ($1.230 million), which were 100% ADB financed. Also, small amounts were used to fund ADB’s financing of the additional cost categories introduced into the project covering leak detection team vehicles, equipment, and operational support, and project management and audit. With the purchase of vehicles, the government requested, and ADB agreed to increase its financing share to 100%.

1,"Road safety assessment. Though not explicitly observed in the 2 years since the completion of civil works, potential increases in traffic accidents are anticipated in the future because the project roads’ smoother surface may tempt drivers to speed and is likely to keep increasing the number of road users. Continuous monitoring is required on the number of accidents along the project roads, and their types and reasons. This may help the government identify fundamental causes and invent and implement preventive policy instruments. As the project roads are near Taraz City, consultations between COR, JSC KazAvtoZhol, the city akimat, the Zhambyl Oblast government, and any relevant authorities are strongly suggested. Further, the project roads are part of CAREC corridors, so those measures should be implemented in concert with the other CAREC countries (footnote 16)."

Subsequently, two PFIs reported covenant breaches on the ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs), resulting in the deferment of disbursements. These two PFIs nonetheless, eventually were able to reduce their NPLs to regain their eligibility status under the program."
0,"A total of $52.6 million (95.6% of the revised loan amount of $55.0 million) was disbursed by project completion. Loan  disbursements  were  on  track  from  the  first  disbursement  on 17 August 2011 and were evenly spread out between 12% and 21% per year, except for the first and last years. This included an imprest advance of $6.3 million, which GOR availed in 2011. Following GOR’s decision to make payments through treasury procedure, the imprest was liquidated against claims between the third quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. Annual and cumulative disbursements of loan proceeds are in Appendix 4, while that of contract awards are in Appendix 5. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure allowed up to $100,000 equivalent per individual payment, which could have been enhanced considering the capacity of the investment program management unit (IPMU). Of the total allocation of $273.0 million under the MFF, $219.9 million was utilized ($50.0 million under project 1, $117.3 million under project 2, and $52.6 million under project 3) and $53.1 million was cancelled."
1,"The loan application requirements as prescribed by the government included: (i) a feasibility study report following government guidelines under Decision No. 48/2008 / QD-TTg dated 3 April 2008; (ii) management of construction investment projects under Decree No. 12/2009 and Decree No. 83/2009/ND-CP dated 15 October 2009; and (iii) guidance on the management of construction projects under Decree No. 112/2009 / ND-CP dated 14 December 2009 and 04/2010 / TT-BXD dated 26 May 2010 of the Ministry of Construction. Other application and evaluation procedures followed VDB procedures for government loans. One such requirement that had a negative impact on the private vocational colleges is the loan security over the loan term for assets not formed from the loan and with a minimum value of 15% of loan value. This loan security is in addition to the assets formed from the loan. For construction works, the VDB did not require that land use right be mortgaged. However, the VDB kept the original copy of the Certificate of Land Use Right. This constrained a private vocational college from further investment using its own assets."

The project was reclassified as resettlement category B and a land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) was prepared. Implementation of the LARP was significantly delayed. As requested by the ADB mission in 2013, the LARP was updated by incorporating the most recent compensation packages in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement. Based on the LARP, a grievance redress mechanism was established, and a complaints log maintained. During implementation, the project road alignment near the border was shifted slightly to avoid any impact on people and structures. Accordingly, the resettlement category was downgraded to C, and a due diligence report was prepared and disclosed.15 15 MOTR. 2015.

0,"An important action taken by Ministry of Economy (MOE) was the recognition of the specific needs of women entrepreneurs. For this purpose, two assessments have been carried out through SME DNC on the needs for Business Services among Women Entrepreneurs (each targeting more than 700 women) during the program implementation. The survey included identification of the (i) main obstacles in doing business, (ii) problems in provision of business development services (BDS), (iii) most important BDS services, (iv) business dynamics in the past year and prospects for the next 12 months, (v)  need for financing, (vi) findings from focus group discussions, and (vii) conclusions and recommendations. The survey established a basis for effectively targeting women entrepreneurs in future operations of the SME DNC. The analysis of one of these large-scale surveys shows that two-thirds of the women respondents identified high taxes as one of the main obstacles for their businesses along with poor access to finance and high cost for the utilities combined with their poor quality. Almost the same issues were revealed when analyzing obstacles for start-ups. Compared to 2013 data, the number of respondents considering information support services important increased from 16.5% to 29.7%. Regarding the most needed services, the most requested were consulting and advice, training, and information support (45.7%, 44.6%, and 43.0%, respectively). More than 50% of the respondents confirmed the need for business development services and their readiness to pay for the services. As for the business dynamics, 26.3% of the total of 689 respondents reported the growth of their business compared to the previous year, 25.1% reported a decrease, and 37.7% said “no changes”. Trade sector reported more negative dynamics than service and production sectors. As for the problems with the access to finance, 69.7% of all responses considers high interest rates as the main problem, followed by short loan maturity terms and high collateral requirements. In addition to that, societal prejudices towards women entrepreneurs and lack of confidence among women, especially at startups level, were mentioned. Moreover, as analysis shows, men have more opportunities for starting business and for informal networking, which is not a case with women entrepreneurs. Women lack venues for networking, especially in the rural regions of the country. The results of the surveys were discussed at the workshop in Yerevan with participation of all key stakeholders including ADB. In addition, a gender sensitive value chain analysis had been also introduced (4 value chains). SME DNC staff underwent trainings and improved women presence through appointment of (i) woman member in its Board of Trustees and (ii) establishing of the coordination group on women entrepreneurship. SME DNC also developed its own strategy with focus on women entrepreneurship and women have become a priority beneficiary group for the agency. To support implementation of the national strategy MOE implemented the following actions: introduced annual award ceremony to women entrepreneurs to recognize role of women in the country`s economic development, support networking among women entrepreneurs, encourage other women and give them positive examples of doing business."
1,"One of the more significant issues was managing borrower expectations, particularly (i)  the time needed to complete the procurement process under ADB guidelines and (ii) the  expected versus the actual bid prices. Both issues caused distress between the donor and the  executing agency—expectations of the time needed to complete a transaction are often  unrealistic and bid prices are higher than expected—especially when the executing agency has  limited exposure to ADB procedures and to the prices of the goods and services proposed  under the project."
0,"Capacity development under project 3 and the multitranche financing facility. All five project 3 outputs were achieved. A structured institutional and capacity development plan (ICDP) for 15 ULBs and concerned state bodies was developed based on a detailed study identifying the gaps and measures required for strengthening the governance and institutional management structure. Over 650 trainings were imparted to staff of 15 ULBs and state bodies in municipal services such as responsive grievance redress, construction management, safeguards, gender mainstreaming, O&M of municipal services, asset management, financial management, urban governance, and service delivery. Over 30 different kinds of community awareness campaigns on topics including health, housing, sanitation, and gender issues using different media were conducted in 15 ULBs. Actions under the ICDP included use of contractual staff for municipal services such as SWM and urban drainage, use of contractors to manage the STPs through provisions for O&M embedded in their contracts, and outsourcing water bill generation and distribution by the public health engineering department (PHED), in addition to leveraging public– private partnership models for SWM. These actions have resulted in more effective reallocation of human resources. The three MFF outputs were achieved in 15 ULBs: (i) preparation of infrastructure base maps for 15 ULBs; (ii) delivery of trainings under the ICDP; and (iii) introduction of double-entry accounting, computerization of financial management systems, and improvement of asset management systems."

1,"Project management capacity. Given that this project was the first ADB-financed loan that USP had implemented, the project management learned as the project progressed. Although ADB had provided training, key staff changes—USP’s procurement specialist, intermittent project manager, and architect, who departed and then resumed as consultant— contributed to the challenges of understanding ADB’s processes and requirements. In addition, the omission of safeguards supervision from ADB missions during implementation meant there was no opportunity for building USP’s safeguards capacity. The lessons learned from this are being applied in tranche 2 of the investment program for the development of the new Solomon Islands campus."

1,"The GAP implementation showed many good lessons learned relating to address gender inequality issues in vocational training. One of the key lessons learned is the need to build gender awareness for all stakeholders involved in the project and promote leadership in addressing gender inequality issues within each vocational college. The experience from project implementation showed that building gender awareness should be a start foundation to make sure that all stakeholders have a common understanding of what are key gender issues and why vocational colleges should address these gender issues. This also helps all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the importance of values and attitudes that encourage female and ethnic minority participation in non-traditional occupations. Besides, it is also important to promote the school leadership in developing and implementing GAP within each vocational college to address their own specific gender issues. Monitoring and supervision provided by school leaders for GAP implementation will be crucial to making sure to achieve expected gender results and strengthening the leadership in addressing gender issues within each vocational college."

Although women have great potential in SME sector development in Armenia, their potential was not considered until the launch of the project. Under WESSDP, the government of Armenia started making concrete steps for the promotion of women’s entrepreneurship at a policy level and put women’s entrepreneurship on the government agenda. There was openness at the government level to adopt gender sensitive SME policy and give business development opportunities to women entrepreneurs. Until now, the policy is in place and it is positively assessed by different stakeholders."

0,"Women’s voice and gender equality in decision-making. Women have received strategic benefits under the project and GAP design features through institutional and community- level action groups and health and planning governance bodies leading to gender-responsive health sector plans and improved community health governance. Giving women a voice in various working groups, has ensured that all plans, including cross-border action plans, have taken gender mainstreaming and women’s needs in the communicable disease control program of the health sector into consideration. Under the Malaria Elimination Action Framework 2016–2020, for example, specific interventions for women, such as provision of bed nets for women with children under 5 years old, were identified; and through the GMAG, the CDC and malaria training curricula and health workforce development plan now include gender-related content (analysis, strategy, approaches). A checklist was also developed to ensure that gender concerns were addressed in all project workshops and technical training sessions. Case study 2: Dul Sotheara (Midwife at health center in Sam Pao Poun commune, Kok Thom district, Kandal province), aged 34 years old, is a member of the Rapid Response Team at the health center. She has attended trainings on the prevention of communicable diseases and learned various topics such as prevention of diarrhea, malaria, respiratory infection, pneumonia, rabies, avian flu, swine flu, cholera, H1N1 virus. With her increased her knowledge and skills as a midwife, she is qualified to perform higher level functions like administering immunization and diagnosing diseases. Her main responsibilities included data entry of recorded cases, patient consultations, vaccinations, deliveries, and communicable diseases outbreaks into the Health Information System.

1,"The three key lessons from implementation of the project and the additional financing are as follows. First, putting forward those innovative ideas in proper perspective is important. The project originally had its planned activities but modified itself to cater the need of the evolving situations without compromising its basic principle during the project implementation. For example: (i) CFW scheme was launched to provide job opportunities not only to poor villagers but also to factory workers as factories were closing down due to global economic downturn in 2009; and (ii) CFRS was established and now operational, whereas the project was originally supposed to provide recommendations only. Second, engaging the local community in the implementation, supervision and monitoring of the CFW and FFW schemes with a technical support from the line ministries yields rich dividend by ensuring sustainability and bringing ownership of the created assets. Third, a project director who is deeply involved in project supervision and implementation, and committed to robust oversight, contributes significantly to the successfully project implementation. The project also offers more generic lessons about the desirability of continuity in staffing and administration from ADB resident missions, and the very positive impacts that can be obtained from quick and flexible responses to evolving situations. ADB staff worked closely with well-chosen, directly recruited implementing consultants to maintain intensive day-to-day supervision of the project. This ensured that problems were averted, rather than being addressed during review missions."

At approval of project 2, the PMO Barrages was implementing the Jinnah Barrage rehabilitation project, financed by the World Bank, and had adequate skills and staff resources, which were strengthened through 11 additional staff appointments for project 2. For project 3, PMO strengthening was delayed and, during the interim period, staff from Jinnah Barrage helped in implementation. The PMO’s experience gained in large projects with JICA and the World Bank helped in the award of the consultancy and civil works contracts. Construction supervision consultants supported the PMO. For project 3, ADB and PID agreed to attach project 3 to the PMO Barrages instead of the PMU for better project administration. By early 2015, the PMO had completed the recruitment of all staff."

The financial internal rates  of return (FIRR) for project  6 are  estimated  to  be 20.3% (DISCOM-C), 2.6% (DISCOM-E) and 2.6% (DISCOM-W), higher than the project’s estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 2.0% (Appendix 14). The FIRR reevaluation for DISCOM-C is lower than the FIRR calculated at appraisal (37.4%), because the appraisal evaluation considered incremental revenue from increased electricity sales (from non- technical loss reduction) as sustainable, whereas in practice, any revenue in excess of the annual revenue requirement (ARR) is offset against revenue in future years.32 However, a real rate of return of 20.3% in a regulated sector is considered a good achievement and reflects the high returns that can be achieved through a reduction of network losses. The reduction in network losses arising from project 2, 4, 5 and 6 has also reduced DISCOM-C’s losses (footnote 29) and contributed to continuous improvement in debt service coverage ratio.33 The new assets created under the facility and project 6 are being well maintained and operated, with adequate budget provisions for repair and replacement of parts and equipment. Hence, project 6 is considered likely sustainable."

0,"Implementation arrangements approved at appraisal were appropriate and followed past, on-going, and successful projects executed by MARD. The project was among the centrally- managed projects for which MARD was the executing agency and delegated project management to its CPO, formed to implement large-scale activities. There was a CPMU within the CPO and one PPMU under the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in each project province that implemented smaller-scale activities. A separate WRU project management unit (WRU-PMU) implemented activities related to the new WRU campus. A minor change was made in 2014 to transfer the functions of implementing agency from Hai Duong DARD to Hai Duong IMC. The change was in line with the government strategy to gradually transfer ownership of the constructed pumping stations to IMCs and to strengthen IMC capacity. The AFD parallel co- financed outputs followed AFD’s project management procedures and ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009 (SPS). AFD and ADB staff joined semi-annual review missions and regularly exchanged information to monitor project progress and resolve issues. The PMISC added value in supporting the CPMU, WRU-PMU and PPMUs in overall project implementation and strengthening project management capacity. In summary, the project implementation arrangements were appropriate. There was reasonable decentralization of authority between the CPO and PPMUs, which increased project ownership by the participating provinces, while the CPO simultaneously supervised implementation progress and helped build PPMU capacity."

1,"Achieving the outcomes contributed to the intended development impact of improved health of the GMS population. No major outbreaks of communicable diseases of international concern occurred since 2011, with only scattered cases of cholera, Japanese encephalitis, and avian influenza. By 2017, the burden of communicable diseases had decreased significantly. Cambodia declared the elimination of malaria, filariasis, and trachoma as a public health problem before the end of the project. The prevalence of schistosomiasis had been reduced from 4% in 2010 to 0.2% in 2017. The dengue incidence decreased from 5,063 cases in 2010 to 1,751 in 2017. The population’s health in general continues to improve, and under-5 mortality (U5M) fell from 44.4 deaths per 1,000 live births (44.4/1,000) in 2010 to 29.2/1,000 in 2017. In the Lao PDR, U5M slowed from the 2010 baseline of 80.4/1,000 to 63.4/1,000 in 2017. The immunization coverage for DPT320 and measles increased from 32% in 2000 to 88% (and 89% for measles) in 2015. During the project period, dengue cases decreased by about 20%; the schistosomiasis prevalence fell from 3% in 2012 to 0.12% in 2015 in targeted populations. In Viet Nam, by 2015, the dengue mortality rate had declined by 42.8% and morbidity by 40%. The national U5M rate fell from 22.9/1,000 in 2010 to 20.9/1,000 in 2017.21 The project contributed to the significant decrease in malaria cases in the pilot sites in Cambodia and the Lao PDR, and prevented an increase of malaria cases in pilot sites in Viet Nam.

1,"Complexity in project implementation. As the PFMRDP involved complex policy and institutional reforms, effective coordination within and between multiple executing and implementing agencies has been required for successful design and implementation of reforms. Complex policy and institutional changes require longer timeframe to be delivered. The absence of an overall consultant team leader to coordinate all project activities reduced timeliness, scope and integrity of routine and final reporting, resulting in a heavier workload for ADB project officer. The transfer of administration of the second project grant to the resident mission allowed for closer monitoring and more timely responses to project administration matters that arose. ADB’s role in recruitment of consultants was the right approach given complexity of the program implementation, diverse expertise requirements, and limited capacity of the executing and implementing agencies."

The overwhelming majority of the population within the project area is from the main ethnic group, the Kinh. Of the 800 affected households, only 11 were ethnic minority households. The 11 households were spread around the project districts and were integrated into the mainstream Kinh society in terms of language, education, housing, clothing, and daily livelihood activities and did not maintain any distinct livelihood pattern. There would be no differential impact on the 11 ethnic households. A specific measure was included in the resettlement plan to ensure that the 11 households were not marginalized in the resettlement. During implementation, the VEC and SEPMU paid special attention to vulnerable households. Meanwhile, the construction activities did not adversely affect the socioeconomic condition or disrupt the life or culture of these ethnic households. Instead, the improved transport conditions are expected to augment their access to socioeconomic facilities."

To ensure successful implementation of the reform program, the Privatization Commission and Pakistan Railways are required to submit quarterly progress reports to ADB explaining the implementation progress of all policy actions, regularly upload PSEs’ annual financial performance reports to the Finance Division website, and list PSEs that are noncompliant with CGR on the SECP website. Governance and PSE reforms remain priorities on the development agenda, as reflected in Pakistan Vision 2025, and under all recently concluded reform programs conducted with the assistance of development partners. Given Pakistan’s deteriorating foreign exchange reserves and rising fiscal deficit, PSE reforms to reduce fiscal transfers will be a high priority. As the PSERP has sensitized the government to the importance of the governance reforms, ADB should remain engaged in public sector reforms over the medium term."

0,"Based on the assumptions and parameters above, the EIRRs were calculated for a period of 26 years (2011–2036), including 6 years for project implementation and 20 years for operation (with some overlaps of construction and operation periods). The EIRR was calculated at 19.7% for the whole project, respectively 21.8% for the roads in Bhopal region and 14.4% for the roads in Jabalpur region. The lower EIRR for Jabalpur region was mainly due to lower traffic level. The recalculated EIRRs are much lower than that estimated at appraisal (ranging 18.3%–45.5%). The lower EIRR is due to higher capital cost, prolonged construction period, and lower traffic growth rates in early years of operation. The recalculated EIRRs are above the ADB recommended discount rate of 12% at appraisal. The project therefore continues to be economic viable."

0,"Before the project, people could only walk on paths near towns and villages as there were no roads. The walking speed was at most 4 km/hour. The villagers of Lingshing Borang, near the Panbang–Nganglam road explained that before the project they walked for 6–8 hours to carry their farm products by shoulders to a nearby town. There were also substantial disturbances during the monsoon season. Human-wildlife conflict was also a common concern as villagers, especially schoolchildren, had to walk through the forest to get to their intended destinations. Now, using vehicles, the villagers can transport their farm products to nearby market towns within 40 minutes. For most towns located along the border with India, there were no roads connecting to each other. Most vehicles used roads in India, which required much longer distances. Vehicles travelling along the project roads are estimated to have reduced the traveling distances by about 80–180 km between towns served by the project roads.

No EIRR was calculated at appraisal, but an estimation of economic viability at project completion suggests economic internal rates of return of 16.19% for the project (a net present value of $13.33 million, discounted at 9%), 14.56% for the additional financing (a net present value of $4.80 million), and 15.73% for the overall project (an NPV of $18.13 million).35 The additional financing appears to have been viable on its own. The EIRR estimates are based on benefits from increased production of rice and some vegetables, and exclude benefits arising from (i) transport cost savings from the rehabilitated rural roads; (ii) health benefits from latrines, hygiene, and cooking and nutrition training; (iii) environmental benefits such as roadside tree planting, soil improvement, and composting; and (iv) positive social capital and technical capital impacts derived from improved commune facilities, greater opportunities for interaction and knowledge exchange, and farmers’ enhanced agronomic knowledge. In addition, the greatly increased capacity of the MAFF seed-production facilities and the existence and operations of the CFRS are clear nationwide economic benefits."

In 2010 the Government of the PRC financed the improvement of 223 km (most of km 9–272), and in 2012 the Arab Coordination Group financed the improvement of 93 km (km 272–365) of the road corridor. The project was to improve the 60 km At Beit–Torugart section (km 479–539) approaching the Kyrgyz Republic–PRC border, the last unrehabilitated segment of the road corridor. Together with improvement works in other sections, and the full opening of the corridor to traffic by 2017, this enables all-weather, smooth flow of both local traffic (between Bishkek and Torugart), as well as international through-traffic from the PRC to Central Asia and beyond, unleashing one of the key constraints to national and regional trade competitiveness and inclusive growth. Economic benefits include time savings, increased reliability, and reduced transport costs, while better road conditions and protective structures help reduce the risk of accidental toxic spills and material runoff from vehicles, therefore benefiting the ecosystem of the nearby Chatyr-Kul Lake, which is a wetland of international significance protected under the Convention on Wetlands (known as the Ramsar Convention). During preparation and implementation of the original loan and additional financing, consultations were held with the project stakeholders, who were supportive and provided project design recommendations, and demonstrated a high level of ownership during project implementation."

0,"The project is rated relevant at appraisal and completion. The project’s formulation was aligned with the governments’ development objectives, ADB’s development strategy for regional cooperation in general, and the ICT subsector in particular, both at appraisal (para. 4) and completion (para. 6). While the project’s design was relevant at appraisal, the very rapid changes in the ICT sector globally and in SASEC countries during implementation was beyond the control of the project. The number of fixed broadband subscriptions increased five times and mobile cellular subscriptions three times in South Asia from 2007 to 2012. 42 During that period, Bangladesh and Bhutan both recorded an annual growth rate of 69% in broadband subscriptions, and in Nepal it was 84%. The annual growth rate in mobile subscriptions was 23% in Bangladesh, 30% in Bhutan, and 38% in India. The project was not designed to fully adapt to these rapid advances, as exemplified by the implementation arrangements (paras. 8, 9 and 35) and the flaws in the DMF (para. 9 and Appendix 1), and this was compounded by the significant delay in implementation. Moreover, the project design was not guided by detailed demand analyses and instead assumed that all the internet data traffic that was exchanged through very small aperture terminals (VSAT) at the time would switch entirely to the regional network. Further, for the RTN, the needs of the potential users were not adequately reflected in the design of the courses (para. 58).43 This could be attributed to the project’s modality whereby the RTN component was scoped out of the rest of the project in the form of a TA project, limiting coordination with the village network. Nonetheless, the innovative and pioneering nature of the project, which aimed at facilitating the integration of information, knowledge, and ideas across SASEC, should be highly commended. The objectives of the project remain relevant since the provision of stable, affordable and inclusive internet connection, especially in the most remote and rural areas has not been achieved fully in the SASEC countries and remains a key for inclusive development. The innovative and transformative nature of the project is highly aligned with ADB’s Strategy 2030, which emphasizes promoting innovative technologies and integrated solutions for building the potential for ADB’s value addition (para. 6).44"

1,"Covenants. During the project implementation period, the road experienced a temporary increase in road accidents, including several fatal cases. Within the CAREC program framework, ADB and other development partners strongly recommend the application of modern road safety engineering practices, such as road safety audit of the detailed engineering designs and implementation of internationally acceptable road safety practices during the roadworks. Implementation of robust and modern road safety engineering practices during road works would have a long-lasting development impact after completion of the projects financed by international financial institutions, as borrowers can apply the same road safety engineering practices in maintenance works or national road development projects. Given the importance of road users’ and construction workers’ lives, road safety engineering practices deserve to be integrated into the project covenants. The covenants need to be specific in respect to the road safety engineering practices during civil works, which include requirements in the traffic management plan, the establishment of early warning and working zones, temporary signs and markings, and correct usage of user-friendly temporary barriers."

0,"During project implementation, traffic surveys were conducted in July 2011, September 2013, and September 2016. The surveys counted traffic travelling in two directions, and identified nine vehicles types. Counts were collected at four locations along the Bishkek–Torugart road corridor, including at Naryn (km 348), At-Bashy (km 351), the bridge (km 399), and Kara-Bulun village (km 420). The traffic on the project road section was measured by actual vehicle flows recorded at the Torugart check post (km 478). Actual traffic volume increased during 2011–2016 by an average of about 14% per year, with light trucks increasing by about 62% and truck trailers by 59% per year. Light trucks were used mainly for local socioeconomic development activities in the border areas. The truck trailers were mainly cross-border traffic between Bishkek and Kashgar in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The actual traffic counts on the project road section were adjusted by the supervision consultant to annual average daily traffic (AADT) levels by considering seasonal factors, resulting in an AADT level of 81 vehicles in 2011, 123 vehicles in 2013, and 130 vehicles in 2016. It was found that the actual traffic level is lower than the baseline figure of 151 vehicles used at appraisal for the original loan in 2010.1 The traffic survey results are in Table A12.1.

No project performance monitoring report was produced under the project, even though a project performance monitoring system had been expected to be operational throughout the implementation, as indicated in the project administration manual at appraisal. Possible reasons were the lack of clarity on the terms of references attached to the CSC contract and the lack of a relevant covenant in the loan agreement. A project performance monitoring system is a mechanism to monitor the likelihood that an ADB-financed public sector project achieves its intended output, outcome, and impact as stated in the DMF, 24 which helps the government and ADB assess during implementation whether the project design fits the country’s development directions.

The four outputs together adequately achieved the intended outcome: increasing farm  productivity and household incomes. Output 1 enabled the transition to high-value production with  measures to boost productivity and encourage the production of perennial and annual crops as  well as adoption of suitable and environmentally sound technologies and practices for crops,  livestock rearing, and waste management. Output 2 strengthened farmer–market links by  expanding on-farm processing capacity as well as processing and participation in production  bases by agro-enterprises. Output 3 improved agricultural practices and food quality and safety  through capacity building and training of farmers, farmer associations, women production groups,  and technical support agencies in high-value production and processing.

However, DOET and BOET in lower performing areas tried to respond to the local realities and adapt approaches as necessary."
0,"The project is rated relevant, as the project was an integral part of Bhutan’s development priorities and ADB’s country strategies both at appraisal and completion. At appraisal, Bhutan’s trunk road network had limited coverage and could not meet the growing demands of larger and heavier vehicles. Limited feeder roads added to the isolation of remote rural areas. To accommodate socioeconomic development and the expansion of vehicular traffic, Bhutan needed new roads constructed and existing road infrastructure to be upgraded and improved. The project design was an appropriate response to development needs for enhancing rural accessibility, facilitating industrial development in the southern areas of Bhutan, and integrating with primary markets in India. The project preparatory TA was appropriate because it enhanced the project’s comprehensive design and incorporated community participation during formulation. The engineering design and alignments ultimately minimized social and environmental impacts. The selected modality was also appropriate for the nature of the project. The DMF was generally well- formulated and targets were clear, although a few proxy indicators were used to measure the achievements under impact. Upon completion, the project continued to be consistent with ADB’s country partnership strategy, 2014–2018, which supported three strategic pillars: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration. ADB lending operations under this strategy will continue to prioritize energy, finance, transport, and water and other urban infrastructure and services.

The envisaged role of the IMUs was to support farmers organizations in technical, administrative, and financial management. The institutional structure for supporting farmers organizations was changed from the program financed IMUs to the Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority (PIDA), PID, and PMU for three key reasons. First, under PIDA rules revised in 2010, services of PID staff were made available to the chief executive of the area water board and to support farmers’ organization. Second, this change was in line with devolved systems in canal command areas elsewhere in Punjab. Last, until farmers organizations become self-sustaining, government support was considered essential. Newly formed farmers organizations were grouped into 19 irrigation management transfer units supported by the government and, as such, staffing and financing of IMUs were excluded from project design."

Meanwhile, the ADB-financed sections were still under construction and scheduled to be completed by December 2015. The contractor issues caused delays: the contractor for package 5 was terminated due to bankruptcy (para. ), so the VEC needed to undertake new procurement for the remaining work (package 5A); the contractor for package 6 was substantially delayed and could not meet the extended completion target of March 2014, mainly because of slow mobilization, additional work, and financial capability. The VEC and the ADB missions supervised project progress closely and provided a variety of support to the contractors. The ADB-financed sections were substantially completed in February 2015. The remaining works included fully completing the service areas, slope protection, drainage, fence, local roads, and electricity transformations.

0,"ADB should develop and implement procedures to promote better understanding at  project inception of ADB's requirements for safeguards implementation. This could include a  mandatory workshop during the inception mission that focuses on project-specific safeguard  requirements, and ADB's expectations as to how these should be met by the executing agency  during project implementation. A follow-up workshop should then be held soon after any  safeguards monitoring consultants have mobilized to ensure that all parties responsible for  safeguards have a common understanding of ADB's requirements and expectations, and how  these are to be met in the project-specific situation. Closer monitoring of compliance with  safeguards covenants is needed to ensure that non-compliance with ADB requirements is  identified and corrected at an early stage, thereby reducing the likelihood of project delays and  the implementing agency's safeguards compliance costs. These measures have been  incorporated into the implementation plan for the new energy project with EDC that has recently  been approved (footnote 23)."
1,"Ensuring improved education quality. In the future, the design of projects involving investment in school infrastructure should not be solely infrastructure-focused.

1,"This financial analysis was undertaken in accordance with the ADB guidelines for financial management and analysis of projects.1 Of the 18 project vocational colleges, 15 are public and 3 and private. Private vocational colleges are financially autonomous but currently, public vocational colleges operate under a hybrid financing model, whereby their operating costs are covered by cash flows from rate-controlled tuition for degree programs, other revenues (such as short-term training, and service contracts with industry), and from the state budget. Based on the increase in rates and planned higher enrollments (offset by projected lower state budget support), as well as increased other revenues, it is forecasted that the project vocational colleges will generate sufficient cash flows from their existing operations (and budget support) to satisfy principal and interest payments (Table A9.4).

At appraisal, the road network in Bhutan comprised 4,947 km of roads with 1,632 km of national highways, 489 km of district roads, 813 km of feeder roads, 150 km of urban roads, 717 km of farm roads, and 560 km of forest roads. The road network provided inadequate connectivity and coverage. Travel between the east and west regions of Bhutan relied either on a single national highway in the north of the country or on Indian road connections south of the Bhutan–India border for travel between southwest and southeast Bhutan. Road conditions were classified as poor, with narrow roads built into steep hillsides prone to landslides. In the Tenth Five Year Plan, the Government of Bhutan decided that constructing the southern east–west highway was a major development priority.2 1 ADB. 2009.

0,"Increase in human activities and lack of maintenance have disturbed the elephant and other wildlife movement along the underpasses. The camera traps that initially documented the success of the arch bridges as wildlife underpasses also captured the increasing human activities that were not expected and the dwindling of wildlife traffic. The variety of human activity also increased from simple passage to cow herding and recreational bathing and picnicking in and around the underpass area. 6 These activities also extended during nighttime, with these picnickers playing loud music according to some locals. The survey has shown human presence at the underpasses increased tenfold from just 45 people in 2015 to 477 people in 2016 (Fig. A14.1). Further, camera records from January 2017 alone showed that 329 people congregated at the underpasses, the highest of any month. The same human activities, albeit on a lesser degree, were observed in Kali Khola. Anecdotal evidences suggest that elephant movement across the road has shifted away from Neuli riverbed towards the flat lands near the Samrang river which is also an established elephant corridor."
0,"The weaknesses of the WSS system impact both men and women in substantially similar ways and improving access to safe water and sanitation is directly related to reducing poverty and improving public health overall. However, women are the primary collectors, transporters, users, and managers of domestic water and promoters of home and community-based sanitation activities. Women are the major users of water in the household (for preparing meals, cleaning, laundering, bathing children, tending household gardens and livestock etc.) and experience the impact of limited and poor water quality more acutely. They also have different needs in terms of water and sanitation in public places (such as schools and clinics) and more responsibilities for childcare and family hygiene. Women are the most vocal advocates for an improved water supply and link the benefits of a better supply to significant health improvement, convenience and time- saving benefits. In the urban areas women are responsible for family hygiene and sanitation and for providing care in the event of family sickness."
0,"The current economic analysis also considers other factors that could affect agricultural productivity. For example, the increase in agricultural productivity also depends on patterns of terrain and consequently possible irrigation scheme. The terrain in the area served by the CECs is relatively flat in India and Bangladesh while it is mountainous in Bhutan and Nepal. To discount for irrigation schemes applicable to the terrains specific to each country, for benefit estimation in the current economic analysis, the increase in agricultural productivity was assumed to be realized only over 2% of area served by the respective CECs in Nepal and Bhutan and 5% of area served by the respective CECs in India and Bangladesh."
1,"Maintenance. The capacity of the MISE to fund and carry out maintenance is a concern. Increased traffic—particularly heavy-vehicle traffic—is likely to accelerate deterioration of the road surface compared with expectations. As noted in Appendix 9, no definitive data exists on heavy vehicle traffic, but truck traffic is thought to be on the rise (para. 44). Operating the asphalt plant used for construction for maintenance would be impractical and expensive because of a lack of skills in the MISE, and limited demand for asphalt. Roads can be repaired using asphalt “cold- mix,” which is strong, durable, and easy to apply for crack and pothole repairs. MISE has drafted a paper on reforms in the transport sector, including asset management and maintenance funding, and plans to submit it to the cabinet immediately."

The VEC established a Southern Expressway Project Management Unit (SEPMU)—composed of board directors, several functioning departments, and two field offices—to implement the project. The VEC and SEPMU, with assistance from the PSC, implemented all aspects of the project including project preparation and design, procurement and contract management, financial management and audits, construction supervision and quality control, safeguard measures, and loan covenant compliance. The VEC adopted the financial information and management system developed under the ADB TA, with improvement during trial operation. These implementation arrangements were generally adequate for delivering the project outputs and achieving the intended project outcome. The project was one of the first ADB- financed projects managed by the VEC.

0,"The Dili public water supply system is rated unlikely to be sustainable in its current operating mode. It is in decline and for it to shift onto a sustainable base will require a total change in approach with an integrated package of measures covering institutional reform and re-organization. The institutional reform would require establishing an independent water utility, be it a government entity or with some management contract operation included, and with the necessary technical and financial skills to operate the system. The government would need to make a financial commitment and allocate budget resources to operate the system, and strategic investments to enable the system to function efficiently and be maintained. The tariff structure, once these foundations are in place, would need to be determined, based on cost recovery in the medium term. Development partner engagement will be required to support this change, but it should be based on a clearly defined road map with milestones that benchmark the government’s performance."

The long-term focus enabled by the MFF modality was appropriate to the development needs of the country. The DOW involved all relevant government agencies in the project and the program steering committee (PSC), and provided effective guidance and direction. The PSC fostered ownership in the project among the provinces. Appropriate changes were made during implementation to (i) fund NRSC road safety awareness programs and road accident surveys, and (ii) postpone the improvement of road construction for sections to be impacted by traffic generated by construction of the LNG project.

1,"Focus of attention. The crisis revealed economic vulnerabilities and inefficiencies directly and indirectly related to the lack of economic diversification. The oil price decline also exposed the country’s structural weaknesses in PFM mechanisms. The budget’s reliance on transfers from SOFAZ posed a risk to sustained public expenditure since it was pro-cyclical and lacked adherence to rule-based fiscal discipline to deal with adverse economic conditions.40 To avoid the recurrence of similar problems in the future, the government will need to undertake much stronger, bolder, and more robust measures to deepen diversification of the current economic structure and enhance public sector efficiencies. Successfully engineering the shift to a new development model will require persevering with reforms to the make the public sector more efficient, ensuring sustainable public resource management, and developing a deeper and more inclusive financial sector. This will also entail some painful institutional and sector reforms, not least when capacity constraints become binding. It is however also important that the government should stay on course to take some key reforms already under implementation to their logical conclusions in terms of effective solutions.

0,"Financial intermediation loan project. In other countries borrowing from ADB, this type  of private investment in agriculture development has been supported by financial intermediation  loans. In the PRC, it has been the practice for ADB to finance such efforts under a project loan  and for the financial department to manage the onlending and repayment of subloans to  enterprises. It is noted that (i) the limited access by agricultural enterprises to bank financing  remains a common issue in the PRC; (ii) commercial banks are hardly willing to act as the financial  intermediary for such loans owing to the high transaction costs and greater risks perceived by the  banks; and (iii) commercial banks' knowledge of and capacity in agriculture financing are  underdeveloped in the PRC. Given these situations, sovereign financing through a project loan  may continue in the short to medium term. In the long run, however, a transition has to be made  to financial intermediation loans, as the nature of these investments requires a market-oriented  approach for subproject appraisal, risk control, and loan management.

Joint decisions by male and female members of the family increased after attending the PLCE courses. In general, evidence suggests that women and their families benefited greatly from the social and life skills elements in the continuing education courses. This was reflected in improved health, hygiene, school attendance of children, and understanding of laws and advocacy issues.

The residual value was considered to be 36.6% of the capital costs according to the engineering design and estimated amortization (which is consistent with the figure of 36.1% of the capital cost estimated during the additional financing appraisal), and added to the last year of the period. At appraisal for the initial loan, the economic evaluation was for the entire Bishkek–Torugart road corridor, with an EIRR of 34%, but no EIRR was provided for the project section in the appraisal document (either in the main report or supplementary appendix), which mentioned only that “the EIRR on the project road (km 479–km 539) is very low”.3 The additional loan appraisal estimated the EIRR for the project road section as 12.3%. The recalculated EIRR for the project road at completion is slightly lower, at 12.1%. The lower EIRR is mainly caused by lower traffic levels. The traffic forecast results at additional financing were 668 passenger car units (PCUs) in 2017, 844 PCUs in 2020, and 2,576s PCU in 2030, which are higher than that predicted at appraisal for the original loan, and also higher than the actual traffic in 2016 (178 vehicles per day) by about 15%.4"

0,"The improvements in budgetary allocation, estimation and infrastructure upgrade projects was a result of the asset management plan for gradually reducing the maintenance backlog. PID has adopted a third party for the monitoring and evaluation of M&R works. The overall O&M allocation has relatively improved in consideration of the changing demand, and will likely continue to improve. The collected irrigation service fee (abiana) both by farmer organizations and PID administered areas as a percentage of the operations and maintenance (O&M) expenditures fell from 20% in 2007 to less than 10% in 2017. The reasons are (i) abiana rates remained flat and static at PRs333 per hectare, though the rates represent less than 0.4% of crop budget;28 and (ii) abiana recovery rates declined to about 60% of assessed abiana, which is attributable to collection weakness, farmers willingness to pay or dissatisfaction with the irrigation service. With this prevalent situation, it is likely that government will continue to provide O&M funds from budgetary allocation. PID’s operations manual provides comprehensive guidance on O&M for barrages and the program has further improved the technical sustainability, enhanced and sustained water diversions and conveyance capacity, and reducing maintenance requirements in the short to medium terms.

The project’s partial success in achieving DMF outputs (para 39) suggests that DMF formulation should be preceded by thorough study of the market. This will ensure that DMF goals take into account the existing structure of the market and behavior of the market participants.

1,"Disbursement procedures followed ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (as amended from time to time). The project’s extensive use of the advance account contributed to the efficiency in project implementation. To simplify documentation requirements for liquidation and replenishment, the statement-of-expenditure procedure was used. The original disbursement projections were realistic—annual disbursements were largely comparable to the appraisal estimates. Discrepancies were noted between the final audited project financial statements and the loan and grant financial information system for L2699, G0231, and G0448. Reconciliation was done and the discrepancies were found to result from interest charges, pooled funds, and refunded amounts. No expenditure was charged to the project after the closing date. Although retroactive financing was allowed, it was not used. The disbursement details are in Appendix 5."

However, given the sufficient liquidity currently available in the Armenian financial market (para. 38), ADB’s succeeding MSME support interventions should support a shift towards higher value - added economy with a focus on the promotion of new knowledge and advanced practices. For example, efforts could focus on supporting export promotion (to seize trade opportunities triggered by Armenia joining the Eurasian Economic Union) or promoting green finance (such as environmentally sustainable agriculture). Introduction of new loan products under ADB programs (e.g. women-tailored MSME loans) should be supported by piggy-backed TA as often PFIs lack required expertise (para 49)."

The financial intermediary modality has significant potential to support infrastructure development more efficiently and to leverage private capital while building strong institutions. However, building strong financial intermediaries, especially in the urban sector, is complex, slow, and may prove inefficient in the initial phases. The NCRPB and ADB worked closely to address safeguard compliance issues. ADB had to review and supervise the subprojects closely, as the ESMS was new to the NCRPB and sub-borrowers. Addressing pending safeguard issues required significant effort and time. Although the facility provided capacity building support, the experience shows that institutional capacity develops over time, with direct implementation exposure. For new financial intermediaries, a phased approach should be adopted, and more complex subprojects (from a safeguards perspective) should be scheduled after the institutions (including sub-borrowers) gain experience in handling safeguards."

0,"As required under the facility (summarized in the FFA, Schedule 1), the DISCOMs were established as separate entities by the end of 2007, with independent boards, management committees, and internal audit functions. The appointment of senior personnel (managers, accountants, and financial management) was completed before the end of 2008. DISCOM head office, district, and service center staff participated in capacity building training, initially focused on project planning, design, and implementation of an externally financed initiative. The training included ADB ICB procedures, quality control, environmental and social safeguards, accounting, and audits. However, the DISCOMs were newly established and there was insufficient time through the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to fully incorporate ADB requirements to the DISCOM staff, especially for safeguards, which were different from those required under domestically funded projects. National and state-funded power distribution projects did not mandate the use of external consultants. In-house central engineering division prepared designs and supervised construction by the DISCOMs. As the sequential projects proceeded, the DISCOM staff were further trained in operational and management procedures, including routine maintenance, computerized billing and collection, use of remote metering, public awareness focusing on the dangers of the high voltage distribution systems (HVDS) in relation to theft, monitoring of power consumption patterns and vigilance regarding increased consumption with focus on agricultural consumers, and financial management and information technology. As a result, district and subdistrict service center personnel are well versed in routine maintenance, billing and collection (including the collection of arrears, which remains a challenge), monitoring of power usage patterns used to adjust the flat rate for agricultural consumers, and monthly reporting.

The same mission also agreed with RGC suggestions that, because the ongoing global financial and economic crisis had substantially reduced employment opportunities in Cambodia, it would be desirable to significantly increase job creation possibilities through the food for work program. Accordingly, it was agreed (i) to increase the ceiling for subprojects to $10,000 (from $5,000) and possibly above, subject to ADB approval, (ii) to contract out subprojects (so long as labor was locally sourced), and (iii) to allow cash as a means of compensation (hence the genesis of a ‘cash-for-work’ program).

However, as the collection of such data was discontinued, an alternative source of information—the Global Gender Gap Report published by the World 18 In rural areas, there were few women entrepreneurs with officially registered business in agriculture (most common economic activity in rural areas). 20 This is explained by liquidity inflow following the CBA’s 2015 regulation on six-fold statutory capital increase, from AMD5 billion to AMD30 billion (starting 01 January 2017). Economic Forum)—was used.21 This report collects data on (i) the percentage of firms with female participation in ownership and (ii) the percentage of firms with female top management. From 2013 to 2017, the number of firms whose ownership includes women grew from 32% to 34% and the number of firms with female top managers increased from 14% to 24%. These growth trends reflect the improvement in the enabling environment for women entrepreneurs. Based on the above-mentioned positive trends and strong assurances received from MOE and SME DNC, the ADB team considers the outcome achieved."

0,"Based on updated data and the estimates for the economic costs and benefits, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the entire project and for each project road, considering 6 years for construction and 20 years for operation. The EIRR was recalculated at 15.8% for the whole project, which is lower than that estimated at appraisal (19.9%).8 The difference is mainly due to higher capital costs and lower traffic volumes than anticipated. The recalculated EIRR exceeds the ADB minimum required EIRR at the time of appraisal (12%), indicating that the project is continuously considered economically viable. The cash flows of the EIRR calculations for the project are in Table A12.4. The EIRRs for each project road are attached in Table 12.5 to Table 12.8."
1,"An ambitious target for rehabilitation of 60% of significantly damaged schools by July 2018 was set under the program. The Ministry of Education did not have the capacity to implement construction projects on such a large scale. This necessitated the establishment of a construction implementation unit within the executing agency, the MOE, for management of construction contracts. The establishment of the unit and the transparent procurement process for construction services delayed the start of the school rehabilitation program, with the majority of works being completed towards the end of the implementation period. This led to the construction implementation unit defining a data management system, which is currently being developed based on its experience from the school rehabilitation program. Once functional, the data management system could potentially be used as a best practice, particularly in smaller Pacific economies."
0,"Road improvement component. At appraisal, the project’s primary output was 60 km of the Bishkek–Torugart road rehabilitated with special structures to protect the environment, preserve the road structure, and reduce vehicle crashes. At completion, 60.033 km of the road section (km 478.580–538.613) was upgraded. The improvement included subgrade enforcement; surface repaving; construction of bridges, culverts and a drainage system; and installation of road safety facilities (traffic signs and road markings). The road section was designed to meet national Category III road standards with two lanes (carriage width of 7 meters) and a shoulder (2 meters width on each side). The design speed is 90 km per hour. To prevent cracking caused by a freeze– thaw cycle, an improved engineering design was incorporated during implementation with an additional 30 centimeter sub-grade layer and deeper side drainage, with additional costs covered by the additional financing. The protection measures for the Chatyr-Kul Lake wetlands included an integrated system of drainage ditches and spill retention ponds, as well as provision of required environmental monitoring equipment. During construction, the supervision consultant inspected and assessed the works to make sure that the specifications were met. The ADB missions observed that the rehabilitated road was of good quality, with an international roughness index (IRI) below 3 by 2017 (as indicated by the additional financing revised DMF), with appropriate safety and environmental protection facilities provided."

Release of food and seed stocks more than the above quantities needs endorsement and approval from the Prime Minister. 19 Following the approval of the sub-decree, the project – using grant funds in the AF period - thereafter helped the RGC to draft several legal documents, including (i) a Decision for the appointment of the CFRS Committee members approved by the Prime Minister (February 2013); and (ii) two Prakas for the establishment of the Secretariat of the CFRS Committee and on the appointment of the members to the CFRS secretariat approved by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance (June 2013). The project drafted SOP for CFRS based on the implementation experiences and lessons learned from various disaster responses carried out under the project, utilizing experiences of other countries, and based on the sub-decree for the establishment of CFRS itself.

1,"In 2016, the Internal State Auditing Committee of the Ministry of Finance initiated a review of all projects under Kazakhstan’s Western Europe–Western China Corridor investment program and determined that the application of price adjustment and contract variations were incorrect and led to an increase of the total cost of the investment program. The committee initiated legal action against the contractors. Following a court decision, in 2017, the Internal State Auditing Committee seized the project documents of all contractors employed under the investment program, including the contractors for the Shymkent–Tashkent road sections, even though their contracts did not include a price adjustment. Such interpretation of the FIDIC contracts and treatment of the international contractors can damage the reputation of Kazakhstan as an employer for large-scale civil works contracts.

Subsequently, the termination of two poorly performing contractors and the procurement of new contractors for completing the remaining works affected the project schedule. With joint efforts and close monitoring by MPRDC, ADB, and the supervision consultants, the contractors improved their performance by drawing contract-by-contract action plans and mobilizing additional resources. ADB approved extension of the loan closing date by two years, enabling MPRDC to fully complete the works and achieve the envisaged project objectives. Eventually, all civil works contracts were completed by the extended loan closing date. Although project completion was delayed, lower project completion costs contributed to project efficiency (para. 11). 27 At appraisal, the EIRR was calculated by each road. The project is, however, considered a state road transport sector project rather than individual roads, as all the subprojects are state highways with similar characteristics and complement each other in a network manner. EIRR satisfying the economic efficiency criteria of 12% was considered robust. At completion, the EIRR was calculated for the whole project supported by calculations for the two regions."
1,"Gender equality should be promoted in developing partnerships between vocational colleges and employers as a strategy that helps to promote girls’ participation in non-traditional occupations. The big challenge comes from employers is that gender bias in recruitment. Preference in selecting male employees for technical works is still quite popular practice that could be a hidden factor to dismiss females from good job opportunities in this area. This practice requires vocational colleges should have a clear strategy to promote girl participation in nontraditional occupations. Therefore, the school's efforts should not only provide gender awareness training and capacity building activities for school leaders, teachers but also employers, in order to increase knowledge and understanding of employers on gender equality. This also requests vocational colleges should have more effort and practical solutions to develop collaboration with employers in addressing social and cultural factors and gender norms. Joining initiatives with employers to address gender factors that are challenging female students in studying technical fields to ensure that they can access to jobs opportunities after graduation. Despite a range of initiatives to promote female students in the non-traditional occupations, for example tuition discounts, free lodging, priority in employment after graduation, positive female role models, it is really need a break-through strategy to promote girl participation in non- traditional occupations, such as pay more attention to explore the hidden factors that limit female participation or analysis of why female target could not be achieved by each vocational college"
0,"Overall, the performance of the contractors was satisfactory and as expected in quality management. Progression charts show that the contractors progressed very slowly over the first full year, which critically affected the overall construction schedule. The PMO managed this through: (i) two-stage payment of the mobilization advance, with the second payment made only after mobilization of personnel, equipment, and materials; and (ii) recovery of advance in equal monthly installments rather than by percentage. One contractor, holding three packages under the project, made very slow initial progress because of a shortage of equipment required for the three packages. The contractor was also unfamiliar with working conditions in Bhutan, a disadvantage in the initial phase of project, but made significant progress advancing construction activities to mitigate further schedule slippage over time."

0,"Performance of the contractors and consultants. During implementation, significant  delays in the mobilization and completion of some of the contracts were caused by the weak  capacity and poor performance of the contractors and consultants. To improve the contractors'  performance, a provision of interim liquidated damages based on progress milestones was  incorporated in the contracts for tranche 2 under the investment program. As these provisions  were not very successful, the executing agency did not retain them under tranche For future  projects, contractual provisions related to contractor performance, such as the mobilization,  staffing, and deployment of equipment and funds, should be strengthened to discourage poor  contractor performance. Likewise, contractual provisions related to consultant performance,  such as the timely mobilization of key personnel and accountability, should be strengthened and  the contract should include a deterrence to avoid the frequent replacement of key personnel.  The construction period of 15–18 months was not adequate for the completion of works in  remote and scattered locations in difficult mountainous terrain during a very limited working  season.

0,"Gender is a significant variable in understanding the spread of communicable diseases, as well as designing and delivering appropriate communicable disease prevention, control and response. Women and girls have specific health needs distinct from men and boys, as is well understood in the context of sexual and reproductive health. Additionally, men and women also have different vulnerabilities to infectious diseases depending on how they are exposed through their different social and gender roles in households and productive activities; and/or they may have different levels of access to—or understanding—of information about disease prevention and treatment. Certain communicable diseases can have serious consequences for pregnant women and their fetuses, particularly for those living in rural provinces. Pregnancy can also make women more susceptible to certain diseases and pregnant women’s specific risks to infectious diseases should be considered when planning a response to emerging infectious disease threats. Gender norms still place the responsibility on women to be the custodians for the prevention, detection and care of infectious diseases among family members. According to Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) 2014,1 maternal death account for 9% of all deaths to women age 15-49, infant mortality was 28 deaths per 1,000 live births, Neonatal and post- neonatal mortality rates was 10 deaths per 1,000 live births and the perinatal mortality rate is 20 deaths per 1,000 pregnancies.

This approach triggered expansion of the mentorship program by SME DNC and 15 women mentees were selected to work with international program of the Charie Blair Foundation to boost their confidence and facilitate their personal and business advancement further. Box 1: Stories of Women entrepreneurs, beneficiaries of the WESSDP Zepyur runs a small greenhouse in village Darakert, Masis. She used to be an accountant for many years, afterwards she was a housewife, with no paid job. Several years ago, she decided to start agribusiness by growing and selling tomatoes. She started growing tomatoes at the small plot of land around the house. However, it was seasonal business and she decided to organize greenhouse. She applied to CARD UCO, microfinance institution (one of the PFIs under WESSDP) for a loan and she received a small loan to develop and operate 300-meter greenhouse where she grows tomatoes. Previous experience in accounting helped her in running the business. Her family members were supporting her in running the business. Alvard used to work for a cake factory for many years. A few years ago, in 2009, she decided to start her own business and to start producing cakes and other bakery products. Her family supported herein her endeavor. She applied to InecoBank (one of the PFIs under the WESSDP) for a loan to increase the production. The loan was of significant amount and helped her to purchase the building, create new products and increase the production. Since she has invested in the building, now she feels more confident and is considering launching other types of products."
1,"Gender equality promotion was also used as a strategy to develop a partnership between vocational colleges and industry and enterprises. To do this, social and gender equity issues and gender actions was identified and provided at the training workshops for key persons from ERU of the industry and enterprises. This effort helped to reduce gender discrimination against female students who participated in non-traditional occupations and build awareness of gender equality in the labor market. In practice, the linkage between vocational colleges and enterprises was also strengthened by some specific actions and collaboration modalities, for example, offering scholarships for female students; providing on-the-job training; training for TVET teachers on innovations and technology; upgrading of school classrooms, equipment and machinery; participation in the school's Board and/ or its committees; and recruiting vocational colleges’ female graduates.

Leakage of benefits to the non-poor was very modest (based on field observations), and overall project management was robust in its targeting practices and consistent in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable groups. Project performance in reducing vulnerability was helped by the general improvement in economic conditions in Cambodia after 2008. The changing circumstances also affected the uptake of various agriculture and livelihood technologies promoted by the project. The project developed the necessary guidelines and contracting arrangements for large-scale activities to manage the complex implementation arrangements. The sustainability of the project will depend on the extent to which the government continues to (i) make funds available to maintain an improved infrastructure stock and properly fund public agriculture extension services, and (ii) allocate budget to the CFRS."

The selection method and evaluation criteria for expressions of interests should be carefully established to preclude technically and financially unqualified consultants. Procurement packages were fragmented into small ones. Only a few consultants, contractors, and suppliers were interested in most of the contracts. The quality of services, works, and equipment delivered was deficient."

Supervision and quality assurance for the remaining works required for the regional network were conducted by BTCL. In Bhutan, the PMC assisted the MOIC in implementing the project until the end of its contract in December 2014. Subsequently, with ADB’s approval, MOIC assigned its own staff to fulfill the PMC’s role until completion. In Nepal, because of the delays in implementation, the PMC exceeded its inputs in the original contract by over 15%. The Ministry of Communication and Technology did not submit any proposals for variations in the PMC’s contract for retroactive approval to the Government of Nepal as required. To ensure quality assurance and supervision of the work, ADB approved the hiring of individual consultants directly by the Ministry. The inputs of the individual consultants also exceeded the limits and the Ministry could not get the necessary cabinet approval for extension of the consultants’ contracts. Thus, ADB approved funding support from another technical assistance “Nepal: Enhancing Portfolio performance.”"

0,The institutional strengthening and operation modernization (component 5) design change reduced the component cost from $10.8 million to $0.5 million as investment and recurrent project cost for IMUs remained surplus and administrative support to farmer organizations provided by the PIDA and the PID from the normal budget was not charged to the project funds (para. 14). Other reasons for the reduction in the component cost were less trainings and the discontinuation of consultancy services. On-farm water management and agriculture (component 5) activities were completed except for a few pilot demonstrations of efficient irrigation systems and staff support to IMUs for scaling up demonstration activities. This also reduced the cost from $6.5 million to $1.5 million.
0,"The project area is located in the remote border districts, in which the population face the risk of being infected with many communicable diseases which are associated with poverty and poor environmental sanitation and poor health services. Women with lower levels of education tend to carry a higher burden of communicable diseases than men. More often than not, there are very few mechanisms to adequately address sex differences and gender disparities in the prevention of communicable diseases. Women’s access to healthcare remains limited, only 59% of rural residents throughout the country have access to health centres and this situation has a large impact on the healthcare of mothers and infants and 60% of ethnic minority women never receive pregnancy check-ups,2 and only 59.2% of ethnic minority mothers have neonatal tetanus vaccination.3 Women were also limited in accessing information on health care, only 49.6% of women know HIV can be transmitted from mother to child.4 Certain communicable diseases can have serious consequences for pregnant women and their fetuses, particularly those living in rural provinces.

As arranged at appraisal, a total of seven civil works packages were procured, including two packages under ADB financing (package 5 and 6) and five packages under JICA financing (package 1a and 1b, and 2–4). For the ADB-financed packages, the procurement activities started during the ADB TA, using the international competitive bidding procedure in accordance with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).17 The bidding documents were issued in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the contracts were awarded on 15 October 2010 for package 5 and on 8 September 2010 for package 6. During implementation, the contractor for package 5 experienced bankruptcy, which caused substantial delays in implementation. The VEC and the ADB missions made some efforts to resolve this issue, including arranging substantial meetings and providing financial and legal support. As agreed by ADB, the VEC terminated the contract on 22 December 2011. The VEC procured a new contract (package 5A) and awarded it on 29 November 2013 to complete the remaining work.18 All of the civil works contractors had problems with mobilization, staffing and financial capability (para. 44), which were the main reasons for the implementation delays.

0,"The project is rated inefficient. It experienced substantial delays, taking far longer to complete than envisaged at appraisal. In fact, it took more than two times longer than expected in Bangladesh, more than three times in Nepal, and up to four times in Bhutan. These delays were caused mainly by the prolonged process in agreeing on the implementation arrangements at the beginning of the project (para. 33). Other causes include slow procurement, delays in securing the necessary government permissions in Bangladesh and India, and poor workmanship of the contractor in Nepal (para. 34). These delays have contributed to the project’s inability to achieve the intended outcomes despite largely accomplishing the outputs."

Description. The Citarum, Ciliwung–Cisadane, and Ciujung–Cidanau–Cidurian River Basin Territory (RBT) is important for the future water supply of Jakarta and its satellite urban and industrial areas. The territory has a population of 35 million. It has been named the “6 Ci’s River Basin Territory” (6 Ci’s RBT). The Citarum River Basin (CRB) is the largest and most strategic of the rivers. The 6 Ci’s RBT will be managed under a coordinated framework that recognizes both the role of water in fulfilling economic development targets in a sustainable manner, and the diverse individual characteristics and needs of each of the sub-basins. Since 2007 ADB had initiated some work for institutional strengthening for water resource management in the Citarum, Ciliwung–Cisadane, and Ciujung–Cidanau–Cidurian RBT. Subsequent to developing the road map for integrated water resources management (IWRM) in the CRB, the government requested ADB support to ensure that the institutions for water resource management can sustainably implement and maintained the investment under the roadmap. ADB approved the TA in late 2008, with funding from the government of the Netherlands, TASF, and from the Multidonor Trust Fund under the water financing partnership facility.1 The TA was piggybacked to the multitranche financing facility for the Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management Investment Program (ICWRMIP) in Indonesia. The TA aimed to provide institutional support to the investment program and its first project IWRM activities in the CRB, and to support the planning and programming of the 6 Ci’s RBT. Expected Impact, Outcome, and Outputs. The expected impact was sustainable management of water resources for economic and social development in the 6 Ci’s RBT. The expected outcomes were (i) improved capacity for IWRM in the 6 Ci’s RBT in accordance with the 2004 Water Law, and (ii) effective and efficient implementation of the ICWRMIP. The TA had seven outputs: (i) improved mechanisms for national and regional IWRM planning, programming, and funding; (ii) a strategic river basin plan (Pola) and its associated investment and implementation plan (Rencana) for water resource development and management in the 6 Ci’s RBT; (iii) the Java Spatial Model (JSM) for land use and water resources planning in the 6 Ci’s RBT; (iv) groundwater management and water allocation strategies for the CRB; (v) a flood model  and flood management strategy for the upper CRB; (vi) an integrated hydrological and water quality decision support system for the CRB; and (vii) a climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy with implementation of pilot projects for the CRB. Delivery of Inputs and Conduct of Activities. On 29 July 2010, the ADB Board approved a major change in scope to increase the TA amount by $2.55 million to expand the scope on climate change adaptation and mitigation. The additional TA amount was financed by the ADB Climate Change Fund ($850,000 for mitigation and $1,700,000 for adaptation). The TA and loan (PFR1) administration was transferred to the Indonesia Resident Mission on 1 July 2010. On 15 May 2012, the President approved a minor change of TA scope and increase in the TA amount by $1 million, funded by the government of the Netherlands for additional technical capacity building and further analysis on two options of the upper Citarum flood management strategy. An estimated 124 person-months of international consultancy and 310 person-months of national consultancy was envisaged. The actual consultant inputs were 257 person-months (international) and 859 person-months (national). There were six consulting firms for each TA component and four international individual consultants. The TA components were implemented by BAPPENAS; Research Center for Water Resources, and the Directorate of Water Resources Management under Directorate General of Water Resources of the Ministry of Public Works; and the Ministry of Environment. The first consultant mobilization was on 1 October 2009 to support the TA outputs (i) and (v), followed by another consultant mobilization (8 November 2009) to support output (ii), (iii) and (iv). The Korean Water Resources Corporation (K-Water), under a memorandum of understanding with ADB, started in August 2010 to support output (vi). The last climate change adaptation and mitigation consultant was mobilized in December 2010 to support output (vii). The inception meetings were conducted for each of the TA components in 2009–2011. The TA was extended three times: (i) from 31 December 2012 to 30 September 2013, due to minor change in scope and additional funds approved on 12 May 1 Financing Partners: Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. 2013; (ii) from 30 September 2013 to 30 September 2014 to allow the implementation of the pilot activities under the climate change mitigation and adaptation component; and (iii) from 30 September 2014 to 30 September 2015 to complete the ongoing pilot activities, additional capacity building activities for the project implementation units and the local communities, and to the prepare additional knowledge products. All of the TA components were completed during 2012 – 2013, except the climate change adaptation and mitigation component that was completed in 2015. The quality of inputs was adequate to achieve the intended outputs: (i) formulating reports, (ii) supporting and delivering capacity building for the river basin organization to develop the water resources management strategic plan and master plan for the 6 Ci’s RBT (Pola and Rencana) using the JSM, (iii) developing the flood model and flood management strategy for the upper Citarum basin, (iv) initiating water resources data management and decision support system in the CRB, and (v) piloting and studying the climate-change mitigation and adaption in the CRB. The split of 6 Ci’s into three separate river basin territories late in the TA implementation period (2012) increased the work duration, the experts’ inputs, and the river basin planning document development (Pola and Rencana) under the output (ii). The river basin council had to be reestablished as well in each of the three river basin territories. ADB reviewed the TA implementation as part of the loan and grant review missions. The implementing agencies (IAs) provided adequate support for the consultant and actively participated in TA review mission. The executing agency (EA) was satisfied with the TA input as it supported the implementation of ICWRMIP. ADB submitted a semiannual TA progress report through the Netherlands’ embassy in Jakarta. The performance of ADB, the consultants, the EA, and the different  IAs were satisfactory. Evaluation of Outputs and Achievement of Outcome. The TA achieved the outcome of increased capacity of IWRM and partially achieved effective implementation of the investment. The outputs are successfully completed: Citarum roadmap institutional strengthening, institutional strengthening and spatial planning for IWRM in 6 Ci’s RBT, development of key policies and strategies for water resources management, upper CRB flood management, decision support system development, and climate change adaptation and mitigation pilots in CRB. The TA has achieved all the major targets, and produced a knowledge product for river basin management planning in Indonesia.2 Overall Assessment and Rating. The overall assessment is successful. The TA was relevant as it supported the investment of IWRM implementation. The TA was effective as it delivered all the planned outputs and outcomes by conducting capacity building for basin planning as part of the institutional strengthening component, supporting the establishment of the basin councils and provincial working group for Citarum roadmap, piloting several climate-change adaptation and mitigation activities in the field, and disseminating TA outputs by publishing a book as ADB knowledge product. The TA was less than efficient because it required 33 months extension and had the undisbursed amount of $0.4 million out of $11.2 million of TA budget. The TA is likely to be sustainable becuase TA outputs and pilot projects were formally handed over to the Government to enable proper maintenance. The basin plan documents (Pola Rencana) is the basis for the river basin organization to develop their future plan and program as required by the water law. Supporting the government in the formulation of a basin plan such as Pola and Rencana takes longer, since it not only needs TA from the consultant, but there are also several mandatory non-technical steps such as public consultation and endorsement of the river basin council. However, long-term technical input from the consultant teams helped the government to take consistent approach in basin plan development. It has also improved the quality of the basin planning development. As $385,883 was undisbursed/unutilized from savings in the pilot activities and contingencies under the climate change adaptation and mitigation, a better planning on the TA activities would allow for funding optimization. Recommendations and Follow-Up Actions. ADB can help the government implement the basin plan (Pola and Rencana) in each river basin territory of the 6 Ci’s after the Minister of Public Works and Housing legalizes the documents. A strong legal basis is needed for the decision support system for continuous implementation of an IWRM support system. Therefore, the development of a legal basis for a data sharing agreement among stakeholders is advised. The integration  of IWRM planning and programming could be piloted in one river basin, if there is strong political will from the central and local governments.

0,"The project substantially delivered all its expected outputs and their targets, albeit with some delays and underachievement of one gender-related indicator. The ten constructed and/or rehabilitated pumping stations provides irrigation to 11,200 ha and drainage for 49,000 ha as intended. This directly contributed to achievement of the outcome. Farmers interviewed by the project completion review mission confirmed the efficacy of the infrastructure provided. They were happy with the upgraded irrigation and drainage system which ease their field work and enabled better control over water supply for paddy rice and vegetable crops. Other positive project results include damage prevention for residential land which makes up as much as 30% of all the land within pumping station service areas;15 and improved inland water transport, since the new SCADA system allows real time monitoring of water level at the major structures and sluices, allowing barges and boats to pass through the BHH system’s larger canals with fewer delays."
0,"The project is rated likely sustainable. The entire project expressway opened to traffic on 8 February 2015. Currently, the expressway is operated by a joint stock company: the VEC-E, a public–private company established by the VEC in 2012 with 51% share from the VEC and 49% share from two private companies. Currently, approximately 340 staff are working for the expressway. The toll plazas operate 24 hours a day. The VEC-E is equipped with vehicles and facilities for emergency rescue, regular patrolling, and routine maintenance. The project expressway has an electronic toll collection and traffic information and monitoring system. To control overloaded trucks, the expressway has installed weighing equipment at all entries. According to VEC-E data, the expressway traffic increased sharply in 2017 and 2018. The actual budget for O&M increased from D52,471 million in 2015 to D68,487 million in 2018. The VEC established the current toll rate for five vehicle types with approval from government agencies.31"

0,"The project resulted in significant multiplier effects that were either not expected or were  not thought to be significant during project design. In Thimphu, land pooling allowed a  development approach that minimized impacts on developed properties and influenced  pioneering regulation to preserve built heritage (para. 40). In Dagana, slope stabilization was a  component that was primarily designed to ensure the sustainability of project investments. This  resulted in an unprecedented increase in construction activity, because works made the project  area stable. Streetlighting in Phuentsholing, which covered 70% of the town, increased personal  safety and security beyond urban road driving safety, and is widely documented. While not a part  of the project design, the project leveraged resources and led to further financing, including from  SNV and Japan International Cooperation Agency."

The focus on targeting vulnerable people in areas experiencing both intense drought and extensive flooding was appropriate, as was the extension of project activities into both wider livelihoods and environmental and disaster protection dimensions. The additional financing became innovative in its approach to agriculture extension, for example by pursuing a suite of complementary measures to target poor farmers and including the use of “farmer technical congresses” to mix farmers of different types with each other and the private sector. The gender action plan under the additional financing closely addressed the needs of women, helping minimize gender disparities in decision-making, access to economic resources and employment, and food security. In both the project and additional financing periods, the close attention paid to beneficiary targeting supported the overall relevance of the project."

The number of workers in vocational college skills-testing centers was revised from 1,000 to 1,500 and the number of graduates from 2,500 to 1,500. The revision resulted from limited time because the activity got off to a late start, during the extended loan period. Procurement of equipment, while successful, was achieved with delays. One cause of delay was the necessary but belated establishment of a review and monitoring system (para. 8). Another cause of delay was ADB’s decision in the midterm review to defer approval of four international competitive bidding (ICB) packages until the DVET had established the skills standards for the target occupations (para. 7).

0,"The additional financing had a good system in place to monitor and evaluate sex- disaggregated quantitative data and to capture and report on GAP implementation. Monitoring sheets disaggregating data by sex was developed, and project staffs at all levels for each activity, including national and provincial staff, were consulted and trained on its use in data collection. The additional financing team, including the PMU and consultant team, worked well together as a team and showed a strong commitment to deliver gender equality results. Orientation on GAP implementation, monitoring, and reporting was conducted at all various levels of implementation since the additional financing started. Thus, it was not only the gender specialist, but all team members were aware of the GAP requirements. All these factors enormously helped project review missions to spot and address gaps in GAP implementation. This is good practice and can be recommended for other projects."

While allowing the government’s special requests, such as a third-party review of the feasibility study, ADB continued adhering to sound procurement principles. For example, ADB rejected the government’s request to rebid the DBO contract due to insufficient grounds, and instead offered to assist with post-qualification due diligence of the first-ranked bidder to respond to the government’s concerns (para. 29). The government has since been demonstrating more initiative toward ensuring integrity and quality in procurement."

For Loan B, much of the delay in the beginning was caused by the unwillingness of the private vocational colleges to accept a higher-than-market interest rate for the onlending from the VDB. The VDB was charging the higher rate because initially, it was bearing the exchange rate risk and the credit risk for the loan. The VDB’s involvement in the initial design of the project was modest. It was only after the government agreed to take on the exchange rate and credit risks, and the onlending rate was lowered, that private vocational colleges expressed interest to take on loans. As a result, it took more than three years for onlending contracts to be signed. The implementation of Loan B would have been greatly facilitated if this issue was resolved at the design or the beginning of the project."

The high traffic volume on the HCMC-Long Thanh section was mainly due to fast socioeconomic development in that area, especially in industrial and tourism development. The lower traffic for the Long Thanh–Dau Giay section was mainly due to the whole expressway construction along the HCMC–Hanoi corridor being in an early stage, which was not able to well facilitate and induce the through traffic on the project expressway. Accordingly, the traffic growth rates at appraisal were adjusted by considering actual traffic, the fast socioeconomic development and the expressway network development in the project areas.

0,"The project is considered efficient. During the original loan appraisal an economic evaluation of the project was prepared for the entire Bishkek–Torugart road corridor, with an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 34%. The evaluation indicated that the EIRR for the project section would be low because of limited traffic. The rationale for the project was that the road corridor should be fully completed to generate the benefits associated with the corridor as a whole. The methodology was changed for the appraisal for the additional financing, and an EIRR of 12.3% was calculated for the project road section. During the PCR mission, an economic reevaluation of the project was carried out using the methodology adopted at the additional financing appraisal, with updated data. The economic costs and benefits were compared for the with- and without-project scenarios. The economic benefits included vehicle operating cost savings and passenger time cost savings. The project EIRR was recalculated as 12.1%, which is slightly lower than that calculated for the additional financing appraisal, but consistent with the ADB-recommended threshold discount rate of 12%. The project road forms the last section of the rehabilitated Bishkek–Torugart road corridor. The project section historically accommodated the least traffic compared to other sections, while cost overruns negatively affected the EIRR. The executing agency’s performance was satisfactory in terms of process efficiency (e.g., advance contracting was used for major contract awards, and processing of contract variations and withdrawal applications was timely). There was one loan extension as a result of the additional financing, while cost overruns were mainly attributable to price escalation and unexpected changes in the road design."

0,"The project is efficient in achieving its outcomes and outputs. To assess the efficiency of the project, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project was reevaluated using a similar methodology to that used at appraisal and the updated data.27 The economic benefits were calculated by comparing the “with-project” and “without-project” cases, including (i) VOC savings, and (ii) savings in passenger travel-time costs. The EIRR was calculated at 19.7% for the whole project—21.8% for the roads in the Bhopal region and 14.4% for the roads in the Jabalpur region. The recalculated EIRRs are lower than those estimated at appraisal (average 18.3%–45.5%), which was mainly due to the higher capital cost, a prolonged implementation period, and lower traffic growth rates in comparison with those envisaged at appraisal (para. 11, 15, 34).The EIRRs are above the ADB-recommended discount rate of 12%. The project is therefore considered to be economically viable. The EIRR was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test various scenarios for maintenance costs and benefits. The sensitivity analysis results indicated that the project continued to be economically viable for all tested scenarios. If a 20% maintenance cost increase is combined with a 20% benefit reduction, the EIRR will still be 13.5% for the whole project. The sensitivity analysis confirmed that the project has robust economic viability. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the EIRR was more sensitive to changes in economic benefits. For this reason, the state government needs to pay attention to the socioeconomic development of the project area, foster local transport services, and help increase incomes for rural road users. The details of the economic reevaluation are in Appendix 12."
1,"Close monitoring during implementation. Comprehensive preparation establishes a strong foundation for achieving social and environmental objectives but requires close monitoring during implementation. At preparation, the environmental and social plans were highly comprehensive and based on intensive studies, and the management plans were embedded in detail in the Concession Agreement. Project design and implementation incorporated innovations such as the regulating dam and the downstream program, which have been used in other ADB- financed hydropower projects. Transitioning from preparation to implementation was challenging and required intensive monitoring to ensure that an engineering contractor followed all the requirements in the EAMP. Implementation of the SDP and SEMFOP fell short of targets, particularly in forest livelihoods and providing viable irrigation on the Nakai Plateau. The ability to adapt as conditions develop is therefore critically important, and the project was ultimately effective because of intensive monitoring and additional support."
0,"Gender is a significant variable for understanding the spread of communicable diseases, as well as designing and delivering appropriate communicable diseases prevention, control, and response. Women and girls have specific health needs compared with men and boys, as is well understood in the context of sexual and reproductive health. However, men and women may also have different vulnerabilities to infectious diseases depending on how they are exposed through their different gender roles in households and productive activities. Despite efforts made, gender specific issues are not well integrated into sectoral and local development plans. Women and girls still have to face challenges of stereotypical attitudes on traditional gender roles, unplanned child births, heavy workload, and restricted opportunity for better education, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, language barriers amongst ethnic groups living in remote areas, together with inequality in schooling, nutrition, employment, cultural and social norms have made gender an important social determinant of health in the Lao PDR and/or they may have different levels of access to, or understanding of, information about disease prevention and treatment. Pregnancy can also make women more susceptible to certain diseases and pregnant women’s specific risks to infectious diseases should be considered when planning a response to emerging infectious disease threats. Gender norms still place the responsibility on women to be the custodians for the prevention, detection and care of infectious diseases among family members. The majority of health workers are women. Their usual tasks and responsibilities are more concentrated in lower- level service delivery rather than in decision-making or technical roles in the health sector. Increasing gender equity in the health sector and paying attention to the women’s needs and gender sensitivity will help improve CDC activities and wider health outcomes for communities."

This may be largely due to a lack of continuing budget support for the contemplated reforms. For example, the ILCC failed to maintain the levels of international accreditation that were achieved during the program period. This is due to a lack of budget and the failure to follow through with a privatization of the entity. Moreover, a lack of budget has constrained the conduct of surveillance visits. The government should be urged to revisit its earlier plan for the partial or full commercialization of the ILCC, which will in turn provide a source of funds to pay the costs of accreditation. Furthermore, the ILCC needs to increase its limited number of testing samples to attract more clients and at the same time improve staff competence through training."

As the project progressed, loan disbursement increased and reached its peak in 2014 ($41.7 million). Due to overall project implementation delays (para. ) and liquidation of the loan proceeds used for the LAR activities (para. ), the loan closing date was extended by two years.11 During implementation, the ADB loan had three partial cancellations in response to actual needs for project financing, including $100.0 million effective 26 February 2013, $20.0 million effective 31 July 2014, and $91.6 million effective 28 October 2016.12 The VEC reallocated the loan proceeds several times, mainly to the civil works category. Along with project completion, the loan was closed at the extended loan closing date of 31 December 2016. To handle pending eligible withdrawal applications and liquidate advance funds, the loan financial account was kept open for a winding-up period which was extended three times until 31 July 2018, mainly caused by slow refunding of the unused balance of the advance funds for the LAR. Upon financial closure of the loan account on 22 November 2018, total ADB loan proceeds of $178.8 million were disbursed, about 43.6% of the original loan amount. The undisbursed loan amount of $19.8 million was canceled on the same day.

0,"Since 2000, the foreign trade between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC has increased dramatically. The total value of imports and exports increased from $81 million in 2000 to $5,677 million in 2017 (with a temporary drop in 2016 to $4,341 million due to accession of the country to the Eurasian Economic Union in August 2015). Development of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program corridor, economic development, and implementation of the PRC government’s “one belt, one road” initiative are causing foreign trade to increase rapidly. Domestically, the gross domestic product growth rate in the Kyrgyz Republic has averaged 4.7% per year in 2002–2017. The country’s economic development patterns has been restructured, with the service sector advanced rapidly, and accounting for about 57% of the economy in 2015 compared with 32% in 2000. In addition, the full opening of the road corridor may substantially improve corridor performance and lead to a large increase in traffic. The project road traffic forecast was updated based on: (i) actual traffic data, (ii) completion of the Bishkek–Torugart road corridor, (iii) rapid international traffic growth and gross domestic product growth forecast, and (iv) the country’s socioeconomic development status. This resulted in projected growth in AADT of 19% per year in 2017–2020, 14% in 2021–2025, 8% in 2026–2030, and 4% in 2031 and onwards (Table A12.2) Table A12.2: Revised Traffic Growth Rates and Forecast Results (AADT) Source: Asian Development Bank project completion review mission"

0,"PFR1 is rated less than effective in achieving the full outcome. One of the PFR1 outcomes (improved water quality in CRB waterways and reservoirs) as part of the subcomponent 4.1 was not fully achieved. While water quality improvement action plans had been prepared at the district level, there was uncertainty about whether those plans would be mainstreamed into regional plans and budgeted for implementation. The investments originally planned at appraisal to implement those action plans were cancelled. Only small pilot projects were implemented instead. Three out of four outcomes were achieved: (i) improved reliability of water supply to Jakarta and irrigation areas supplied by WTC; (ii) improved water-use efficiency and increased yields for rice irrigation in three districts in CRB; and (iii) a significant increase in the number of community- and NGO-driven initiatives for improved water and catchment management in the CRB. Despite delays, the WTC was rehabilitated to its original capacity of 31 m3/s and the Bekasi syphon was built as envisaged at appraisal, and delivery rate of water supply to Jakarta was increased from 16m3/s to 21m3/s. At the end of the project, however, the canal capacity has not been fully utilized as the additional water treatment plan has not been built, and the secondary irrigation infrastructures have not been rehabilitated or constructed.  The MOA successfully implemented the SRI program in three districts of the CRB (3,000 ha) with improved water-use efficiency (38%, based on secondary data), and increased yield up to 36%. BAPPENAS, MOH, MOA, and MOEFr supported the communities and NGOs to improve water and catchment management (water and sanitation, solid-waste recycling, conservation agriculture practices, and watershed conservation villages) to increase 50 initiatives."
1,"Project design. The project suffered significant delays in implementation due to its inadequate design. Regional projects by nature involve a far larger number of stakeholders, which in turn makes implementation arrangements more complex, as exemplified by the series of legal agreements that had to be entered into before the project even started its physical activities. While the DMF included as an assumption that the project depends on the proper implementation of multilateral/bilateral agreements among SASEC countries, the project was not able to address the delays in making such implementation arrangements and the related issues during implementation. Besides, ICT projects are very time sensitive due to rapid advancement in technology, equipment, and applications. Moreover, the sector is driven by the private sector, which is generally seen as more efficient and adaptable to rapid technological changes than the public sector. By the time of the project’s physical completion in late 2017, Bhutan and Nepal had already abandoned VSAT for commercial internet connection and formed bilateral connection agreements outside the project. This could have affected the project’s relevance significantly at that point. Also, although the design of the regional network was based on virtual protocol network (VPN) through Siliguri NOC, Bhutan and Nepal were already connected by internet through India, an arrangement outside the project involving the private sector. However, by 2014, no ISP in Bhutan had showed interest in using the regional network, maybe because of the inadequacy of the project’s design. For projects involving many stakeholders, maximum consideration should be given in the project design to efficient and streamlined implementation arrangements. Also, in the design of projects in highly time-sensitive sectors, an institutional set-up is needed that will help to expedite implementation schedules, provide flexibility in adapting to market changes, and engage private sector stakeholders who are generally more active in such sectors."

ADB also provided useful and proactive advice on a day to day basis on procurement, project management, and capacity building of safeguards, especially regarding the environmental monitoring procedures. ADB also provided workshops on the monitoring and reporting of safeguards. In retrospect, the MFF preparation mission should have recognized early on that the DISCOMs were unfamiliar with ADB’s various requirements and procedures. A loan covenant for consultancies should have been included to help the DISCOMs learn these requirements.39 ADB provided timely approvals that enabled revised project milestones to be achieved and contributed to smooth project execution. Furthermore, ADB, the executing agencies, and government officials conducted tripartite meetings with senior DISCOM managers and project staff, which assisted project execution through corrective actions."
0,"The implementation arrangements were consistent with the design at appraisal, for the MFF and its tranches, and appropriate to achieve the envisaged outputs.

The IPMU and IPIUs were assisted by an investment program management consultant (IPMC) and three design and supervision consultants (DSCs) in preparing design documents, managing the tendering of contracts, and supervising construction works. For training, there was CAPP and for monitoring, investment program performance and management system consultants."
1,"Implementation delays occurred during the initial period of the project, particularly with the government approval and tendering processes. To minimize such delays, procurement plans should consider the capacity of executing and implementing agencies to approve bid documents, evaluations, and contract awards in a timely manner. Although several reasons can be cited for the failure of the micro hydro rehabilitation subproject, an important lesson is that new and/or under resourced entities should not be tasked with managing complex project designs with myriad stakeholders and a requirement for multiple approvals."
0,"Working opportunities. During construction, the project provided significant working opportunities to the local people. In 2015 up to 400 people worked on the project, including up to 35 female workers. The supervision consultant hired a range of staff including engineers, surveyors, and technicians, and required over 400 person-months of national consulting services. Implementation of the project has assisted economic development in the project areas. Data provided by the National Statistics Committee indicates 1,167 businesses were registered and active in the Naryn region in 2016, including more than 5 companies providing freight transport services. There were 110 shops and/or kiosks in At-Bashy Rayon in 2010, and 158 in 2015. Before the project 11 trailers provided a variety of services to truck drivers in the border areas. Traffic has increased, and the trailers have become more active. A newly constructed customs building now provides a cafeteria and duty-free shops. These developments indicate that there are more income-earning and employment opportunities for local people. Incomes rose by nearly 50% in At-Bashy town from 2012 to 2016, primarily because of increased income from salaries, agricultural production and working opportunities."

1,"Currently, six government-owned banks on-lend for government-supported schemes funding about 15,000 new rural homes annually. The supply of government-supported mortgage finance for potential homeowners is estimated to cover about 25% of demand. There are important reasons why mortgage market development would provide an excellent entry point for developing long-term finance. With increasing per capita income in Uzbekistan, affordability of houses will increase over time. Also, population growth provides for an increasing demand. Global experience shows that, if properly structured, mortgage borrowers present a low credit risk, generally servicing their debt on time, since housing is an essential need."
1,"Lessons learned bear out the same lessons from earlier policy-based programs: (i) build on ownership for reform; (ii) build on existing efforts; (iii) accommodate evolving policy dialogue; (iv) carefully time the intervention; (v) employ participation and build consensus; (vi) incorporate the need for capacity and institutional development; (vii) keep the design simple and allow for flexibility in the design; (viii) sequence reforms; and (ix) monitor progress (footnote 7). One further lesson, given the experience of this program, is for ADB to stay fully engaged with the program of reforms, whether or not program funds are scheduled to be disbursed in a particular year. All future policy-based programs should be directed to consider these lessons in program design. In retrospect, a stand-alone policy-based grant and loan would have been preferable to a programmatic approach."
0,"For Loan B, other specific aspects of the design diminished its relevance. For instance, the document requirements and procurement procedures that the government imposed on private vocational colleges were too heavy, considering none had previous experience working on Official Development Assistance (ODA) funded projects. Another aspect of the design that had a negative impact was the requirement by the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB)8 that the private vocational colleges put up a loan security (often the land on which the vocational college is built) over the loan term of assets not formed from the loan but with minimum 15% of loan value. This requirement reduced the ability of the private colleges to use their own assets for investments.9"
0,"ADB’s overall performance was satisfactory. The project’s administration was undertaken by ADB’s headquarters until December 2011, when it was transferred to ADB’s India resident mission.

0,"School Scholarship. The school scholarship was designed to benefit primary and secondary school students from poor families by reducing dropouts for financial reasons, and increasing these poor families’ abilities to spend income on other necessary goods (including food, fuel, and agriculture inputs). While school scholarship for the lower middle school (grade 7-9) was not new7, it was a new initiative for the primary school (grade 4-6). As the project school scholarship intervention was in the nature of a one-off pilot, the project adopted a cautious approach by (i) setting poverty rather than merit as selection criteria, (ii) selecting students from grade 5 and 6 and grade 8 and 9 where drop-out rates were high and where students passing out of those grades were due to enter new schools, and (iii) adopting the entitlement level already fixed by the RGC (i.e. $45 for lower middle school and $20 for primary school) so that if the pilot test became successful the RGC might decide to continue with it. The project (through Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports – MOEYS) provided 15,847 cash scholarships to a total of 10,443 students (including 5,510 girl students) over two school years (2009-10 and 2010-11) in 209 schools in two target provinces - Battambang and Pursat.

The fuel component (only) of this short-run cost was used to value non-incremental benefits. Marginal costs of existing coal plants were estimated based on actual historical operating parameters contained in recent tariff petitions submitted by MP’s state-owned generating company. Coal fuel was initially valued at its border price equivalent value (BPEV), based on the World Bank’s coal price forecast and adjusted for the generally lower quality of coal used for power generation in India.

0,"At appraisal, the project cost for PFR1 was estimated at $103.42 million; at completion (as of April 2017) it was $63.84 million, or 62% (Appendix 2) of the appraisal due to loan, grant and TA savings, less government’s counterpart funding, depreciation of Indonesia Rupiah against the US dollar, and cancellation of TA parallel financing from K-Water (Appendix 3). For the loan fund, the total disbursement at project completion was $41.8 million (84%) of the total loan of $50 million at appraisal. This was primarily due to the depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah against the US dollar, since most of the contracts are in rupiah. During project implementation, there were some minor changes between the budget categories and between the allocations for each subcomponent. Those changes were justified on technical grounds. Increases in subcomponent allocations were not due to cost overruns. During appraisal, the central government was expected to provide $18.11 million in counterpart funding for PFR1 implementation. The actual government cash contribution as of January 2016 (based on disbursements) was $5.89 million, or 33% of the projection at appraisal. This proportion is skewed by the depreciation of the rupiah. There was a plan for a second loan extension in 2016 to utilize the loan savings. This proposed extension was to be used for additional works along the WTC, and for consulting services to prepare a feasibility study for priority road map interventions and the DED for selected BWS options under the second tranche. However, the government and ADB agreed not to pursue this extension as the new completion date of the PFR1 would have exceeded the loan repayment date. Therefore, a significant portion of the PFR1 loans was not utilized. Based on the sensitivity analysis during project appraisal, a project cost decrease with the same project benefit gained would likely increase the economic and financial rates of return. The grant total cost and disbursement was $3,614,678, or 96% of the cost at appraisal. The government provided $301,323 in counterpart funds for the grant, compared to $375,000 estimated at appraisal."

The project enhanced the design through physical model studies conducted at the Irrigation Research Institute Nandipur, and Balloki Barrage flood capacity was increased from 6,371 cubic meters per second (m3/s) to 7,362 m3/s. With a larger spillway of 3,398 m3/s, the Balloki Barrage Complex’s safe capacity has increased from 6,371 m3/s (one in 20 years flood) to 10,760 m3/s (one in 100 years flood). A new head regulator that was added to the Balloki– Sulemanki link and barrage can divert additional flows of 264 m3/s, with an overall capacity of 694 m3/s, to the link canal. The Balloki Barrage improved 1.95 million hectares of land through reliable water diversions and enhanced the safety of the structure.

0,"The additional financing followed the same principle as it adopted under the project i.e., not only identifying beneficiaries per se but also determining the quantity of seed and fertilizer each beneficiary farmer household would be eligible to receive. Therefore, instead of providing a fixed quantity of quality seed and fertilizer to all the beneficiary farmer households, the project distributed quality inputs based on farm sizes of the farmer households. This helped not only in expanding the beneficiary farmer coverage and avoided excess use of chemical fertilizer (damaging the environment) but also prevented the inputs being sold at market (i.e., effectively only recycling project-supplied inputs). As beneficiaries were small and marginal farmers owning or leasing less than 1 ha of cultivable land, the project divided them into 4 groups and calculated 3 Prior to the seed and fertilizers distribution, the CPMU conducted Provincial seminar/meeting in each of the target provinces to train local authorities on (i) identification of beneficiary households eligible to get seed and fertilizer, (ii) assessment of demand, and (iii) conduct of open village meeting (OVM) to validate eligible beneficiary households and demands.

0,"It was assessed that the project’s resettlement impact on women could be significant. Poor women and women who head households in the project area were at more risk economically (loss of productive assets due to land acquisition) and socially (risks posed by HIV, road safety, and possible human trafficking) than males. A project-specific gender strategy was prepared and was described in the summary of poverty reduction and social strategy. During implementation, provisions were made in the bidding documents for the contractors to encourage employment of the poor, particularly women, and not differentiate wages between men and women particularly for work of equal value and ensure that all civil works would comply with all applicable labor laws, not employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities. Women representatives were included in all district compensation committees and two district committees were headed by women (District 9 in HCMC and Thong Nhat district in Dong Nai province). Capacity building trainings on resettlement and livelihood were conducted for women and women-headed households in all districts in close cooperation with women unions in various organizations. 62 females attended the vocational training courses (taking 59.6% of the total trainees) and 23 females attended the small trade model. During construction, the direct employment generated by the project was substantial for female workers. The ADB PCR mission noticed that many of the project expressway operation uses a large number of female staff (about 65%), mainly toll collectors. The fast-growing public transport in the project area has assisted and promoted women travelling a further distance and participating more socioeconomic activities. Women empowerment in the project areas has improved."

1,"Environment. To monitor wildlife movement, monitoring cameras were installed in select wildlife underpasses. The monitoring report prepared by an ADB staff consultant in February 2017 revealed that human presence and obstructions near the underpasses reduced use by target species. The project noted the importance of government support facilities such as immigration and forestry check posts, and anti-poaching camps and patrol, especially near the border, to help address wildlife and security concerns. ADB allocated resources to replace lost and damaged cameras and engaged a consultant to continue monitoring the underpasses to provide important information on wildlife use of underpasses in South Asia, where such information is currently lacking. The importance of incorporating climate impacts in road design was also apparent. Lessons learned from this project greatly contributed to the climate resilience guidelines drafted by the DOR to mainstream climate adaptation in road projects."

The momentum for streamlining institutional reforms in irrigation management was created in partnership with the government and development partners. The program delivered the upgraded flood capacity of the Khanki Barrage and the designs for the Trimmu and Panjnad barrages, currently under construction as of 2018. In line with the ADB result framework, the program improved land through irrigation services, and drainage and flood management in an area of 3 million hectares, benefitting 1.2 million farming families and some 8.8 million people, the majority of whom are farmers with limited income from small landholdings and subsistence farming. The program benefits 36% of Punjab’s irrigated area and 16% of Pakistan Indus Basin’s irrigated area. The cropping intensity and farm incomes have increased in the program area from 5% to 7% and 15% to 40% depending on the projects’ baselines."

The project design and formulation at appraisal had several serious deficiencies including the absence of workable institutional arrangements for operating and maintaining the regional network, the lack of a continuous coordination mechanism for project activities across the countries, inadequate considerations for complexities, and the short lead time for procurement. They resulted in significant delays and under achievement of the outputs. Also, ADB did not fully understand the bilateral arrangements between the participating countries and their service agencies. Nor did ADB respond to the rapid advancement in the SASEC countries’ ICT sector, such as Bhutan’s abandonment of VSAT for internet connection in 2016, by making changes to the design, institutional arrangements, or performance targets in the DMF. Such changes would have resulted in more effective and efficient use of the loan and grants.

The MOA implemented this subcomponent from 2009 to 2011, through the district agriculture agencies, as envisaged during appraisal. The introduction of SRI reduced water utilization for agriculture (by 38% based on secondary data) and increased yields up to 36% through organic agricultural practices. SRI activities benefited 26,000 rice farmers and increased the farmers’ incomes because of higher yields and lower cost of fertilizer. The availability of organic fertilizer was secured by providing the farmers with cows. In 2015 and 2016, MOA implemented upland management activities in the CRB. Those activities have been financed with savings from the SRI activities and covered 160 ha of agricultural land. The focus was on sustainable agricultural practices for watershed management and land conservation.

0,"At appraisal, the project’s intended outputs were (i) rehabilitation and upgrading of about 1,080 kilometers (km) of state highways identified under the state road rehabilitation program, and (ii) improvement in the road safety management capacity of Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation (MPRDC). The project would provide (i) consulting services to support implementation of the civil works, and (ii) equipment necessary for MPRDC to enhance road safety. The total investment cost was estimated at $375 million, which was to be financed by the ADB loan of $300 million (80% of total project cost) and counterpart funds of $75 million equivalent (20%) from the government of Madhya Pradesh. It was anticipated that the project would bring substantial economic benefits and lead to socioeconomic development in the state, including improved access to socioeconomic services, better employment opportunities, and improved transport services. In turn, this would help reduce poverty in the region and stimulate economic growth and human development in Madhya Pradesh. The economic internal rate of return of the project was estimated at 18.3%–45.5% for the candidate state roads. The executing agency for the project, which would be implemented over 3 years, would be the government of Madhya Pradesh acting through MPRDC."
0,"As at appraisal, the main sources of economic benefits were (i) savings in vehicle operation costs (VOCs) and (ii) savings in passenger travel time costs. The project supervision consultants calculated the unit VOCs, using 2017 prices. The VOC savings per vehicle-km by comparing the “with-project” and “without-project” cases were estimated at $0.07 for cars, $0.13 for medium buses, $0.15 for light trucks, and $0.65 for truck trailers. Average passenger vehicle speeds were assumed to be 80–90 km per hour for the “with-project” case and 20–25 km per hour for the “without-project” case. The passengers’ travel time cost savings were recalculated by different types of passenger vehicles for working and nonworking time values, with the nonworking values calculated as 30% of working values. The unit passenger time cost is derived from the national average gross domestic product per capita.2 The unit truck driver time cost is based on the average salary of transport workers drawn from national statistical data. Other factors taken into account in the calculation for passenger time cost savings include average vehicle loads, percentage of work-related trips, time costs by different road users, and travel speeds for different types of passenger vehicles and trucks. For generated traffic, half of the benefits were considered. The benefit calculation results showed that the VOC savings were about 69.2% of the total benefits in 2016, but the passenger time-cost benefits increased along with socioeconomic development and income growth and would reach 51.8% of the total benefits in 2035."

In the barrage’s case, there is significant variability surrounding the means with an EIRR standard deviation of 14.5% and a coefficient of variation of 0.51. The EIRR ranged from a minimum of 11.5% to a maximum of 99.0% with median at 25.4%. The project was completed, with delays, at about the same cost. Cropping intensity was found to have increased at a faster rate during the last 10 years than predicted at appraisal. This progressive rate was used to extrapolate the remaining project benefits that could be attained with a cropping intensity of 175% in the next 5 years as canal flows and conveyance efficiency improves as compared to the benefits that could be attained using the 10-year linear projection at appraisal. Early realization of benefits improved the EIRR. In the barrage’s case, elimination of income forgone was calculated on the current statistics. Sensitivity analysis was not applied in this case as the main parameters affecting project benefits and costs were treated as random variables and consequently, the variability was captured within the risk analysis. Possible reduction in envisaged kharif flows may reduce the LBDC benefits however conveyance efficiency improvement is less likely to reduce. The worst- case benefit reduction scenario is the LBDC benefits reducing by 41% with a corresponding EIRR of 12%. A detailed economic reevaluation is presented in Appendix 10."

The field officials have highlighted the need to rehabilitate and  upgrade hundreds of relatively small pumped irrigation systems whose pumping units have completed their useful life. Rehabilitating and upgrading these systems would have a significant  positive impact on water and agricultural productivity, energy savings, and livelihood of the  people. Timing of the project performance evaluation report. As all project works were fully  completed by the loan closing date of 30 September 2016 and all subprojects are fully  operational; the project performance evaluation can be conducted any time. The following factors should be considered at appraisal: (i) Implementation and contract schedules should be prepared with due regard to periods of  harsh weather and operational constraints (para. 38); and (ii) To minimize initial implementation delays, government feasibility studies should be  carried out at the same time as the ADB-financed studies and completed within 60 days  after loan approval (para. 30)."

1,"During project preparation, ADB and executing agency should fully analyze the needs for project implementation support to design reasonable consulting services. For well-prepared projects that can start quickly, individual consultants should support project implementation and management, because they can be recruited easily and more quickly through the individual consultant selection procedure, and their qualifications will more likely meet the requirements of project implementation and management support."

The government has exerted commendable effort in establishing immigration and forestry check posts in critical points, particularly near the border. At the time of writing (June 2019), an immigration cum police and forestry check post is being constructed, almost ready for turnover, near the site of the abandoned check post in Samdrupcholing which fell into disuse decades ago due to security concerns. This is the point of entry for Samdrupcholing where visitors from India enter for recreation near the underpass at Neuli and the Samrang Bridge and is envisaged to contribute greatly to reducing human activities in these critical areas once it starts operating. A forestry check post in Durung Ri, an anti-poaching camp along Panbang–Nganglam road, and an integrated check post in Raidak have been established and are all operational. Based on the experience with this project, support mechanisms such as integrated check post (forest, immigration, and police) should be studied, designed and developed under road projects, particularly for those located near international borders."

0,"The project is rated highly effective in achieving its outcome and outputs. At completion, 5 out of 6 targets were exceeded. Upon completion, the project had improved 1,083.1 km of state highways, which were widened to 5.5–7.0 meters and observed to be of good quality with the international roughness indices ranging between IRI 3–4.25 The traffic surveys at completion showed that the traffic had increased by an average 6.5% per year, which is lower than anticipated at appraisal (average 8.2% per year during 2009–2015 and 7.0% during 2016–2020). Considering the socioeconomic development trends as well as the emphasis on road network development, it was predicted that the traffic would keep increasing in the near future. The improvement of the project roads has led to a substantial reduction in vehicle traveling time and transport costs for both passengers and freight. According to the surveys after project completion, the average vehicle traveling time was reduced by 45%, which is much more than anticipated at appraisal (25%). The rehabilitation of the project roads has also resulted in increased vehicle speeds, from an average 30–40 km/hour before the project to 50–80 km/hour after the project. This can be a safety hazard, especially in built-up areas and certain rural areas. The actual vehicle operation cost (VOC) has fallen by at least 17% in real terms. In addition, fatal accidents have reduced by 41% in comparison with appraisal, due to project development and implementation of ARS (para. 10).26 On average, ARS has been serving over 400 accidents annually. 23 Loan 3189-IND: Madhya Pradesh District Connectivity Sector Project. $350 million.

1,"The project was classified category C for environment and involuntary resettlement, and category B for indigenous people. An ethnic group plan (EGP) was developed. In Cambodia and the Lao PDR, the EGP implementation was satisfactory. Both countries engaged a national gender and safeguard consultant to design and monitor the implementation of the GAP and EGP. In Cambodia, an ethnic group sensitivity and awareness training was carried out to impart how best to work with ethnic minorities and ensure their access to health services. The EGP indicators were clearly defined and disseminated to provincial implementers, who then included budget for ethnic group training and activities in their AOPs. In the Lao PDR, achievements were particularly high in terms of training CDC staff with ethnic group backgrounds (85% of ethnic group staff in provinces and districts were trained) and recruiting new staff from ethnic groups (63% newly recruited staff are from an ethnic group), but also in terms of consistent data reporting disaggregated by ethnic groups; integrating ethnic group issues, activities, and budget in provincial AOPs; and prioritizing ethnic group villages for MHV support. The Lao PMU conducted a study of project impacts in 2017 and found that positive project impacts were benefiting the ethnic groups to the same extent as the general population. The main issues in health services for indigenous people centered on reduced access because of remoteness and cultural practices."
1,"All GAP activities and targets were completed and achieved, but with some issues and challenges. The closure of ADB’s TA, the Gujarat Solar Vocational Training and Livelihoods (subproject 14), in 2014 prior to the completion of all GAP activities was the main challenge. However, GETCO’s commitment to gender equality, reflected when it completed the training program from its own funds, helped the project to achieve its outputs. These issues and challenges underscore the need for (i) sound baseline data as an empirical basis for the targeted percentage of women to be employed and for necessary behavior change communication strategies, and (ii) flexibility in TA timeframe to adjust to a project’s situational context."
0,"Nutrition and Hygiene. Newly developed and/or existing IEC materials (posters/ flipcharts) were used to promote women’s role and gender equality in home gardening and to promote community awareness on nutrition, and food preparation using locally available product. Complementary food cooking demonstrations were delivered for young children from age 6-24 months - with 75.5% of 47,720 participants being female; general health education events were organized for beneficiaries - with total participants of 33,955, including 23,118 (68.1%) female participants. To promote optimal infant and young child feeding practices in order to prevent acute malnutrition using home available local food for infant from age 6-24 months, community campaigns on micronutrient (combined with a more general nutrition campaign) were organized - with total participants of 39,398, including 25,675 (65.2%) female participants. Awareness-raising activities by village health support groups (VSHGs) and farmer promoters (FPs) and hand washing campaigns on hygiene and sanitation were provided to a total o of 31,133 participants - including 21,126 (67.9%) females. Lastly, a guidance note for providing nutritional and livelihoods inputs to target food-insecure households was developed to improve nutrition, hygiene and sanitation practices and livelihood.

Before buying vegetable seeds from the additional financing, Ms. Tem grew vegetables around her house for household consumption and for selling (the remaining small quantity) to neighbors. However, after buying vegetable seeds from the additional financing, she got a good harvest, and expanded her vegetable cultivation. She is now selling vegetables at the market, and making a profit of more than two million KHR (more than $ 500) per year. She is also saving the seeds from the new harvest to grow again. Ms. Tem has used the money earned from vegetable production to buy cows. They now have four cows which they plan to sale in about six months when the calves will be grown up. They are expecting profits and will utilize the money to buy additional rice field."
0,"The project was relevant to the needs of the Viet Nam economy and was aligned with the government’s Vocational Training and Education Development Strategy 2011–2020.5 The strategy sets out to “develop vocational training standards, enable private enterprises to become important stakeholders in vocational training, and strengthen management of vocational training,” among others. The project was also aligned with ADB’s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2012–2015,6 The project incorporated lessons from the Vocational and Technical Education Project into its design. These included (i) identifying in advance the specific programs to be supported to focus on the most in-demand occupations; (ii) implementing skills standards, skills testing, and certification to increase the relevance of skills training; (iii) increasing the teaching skills of instructors through in-service training; and (iv) supporting a social marketing campaign to improve the poor social image of vocational training."

0,"The project became effective on 22 March 2011 and project completion was on 31 December 2017. The project was implemented in 12 target provinces: Kampot, Takeo, Kandal, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, Kampong Cham, Tboung Khmum, Kratie, Stung Treng, Ratanakiri, Mondulkiri, and Preah Vihear. The project was categorized as effective gender mainstreaming (EGM). A gender action plan (GAP) was developed as part of the social assessment and proposed several actions to mainstream gender issues in project activities. Under the additional financing, one action and one target were added to the original GAP. The detailed implementation results are in Table A8.1: GAP Monitoring Table (Cambodia)."
0,"The Government of PNG formed a program steering committee (PSC) to oversee project implementation, monitor progress, approve roads for subsequent tranches, and provide guidance to the executing agency and implementing agencies. The PSC was to meet at least quarterly and to be chaired by the Secretary of the DOW or a named designee. Other members of the PSC were to include the chief executive officer of the NRA; the executive director of the NRSC; senior officials of the Department of National Planning & Monitoring, the Department of Treasury, and the Department of Finance; the valuer general of the Department of Lands & Physical Planning; a representative of the Department of Environment and Conservation; provincial administrators from the five highlands provinces; and representatives of relevant police forces and chambers of commerce.

The subsequent programmatic approach represents a natural evolution from the program, carrying forward reform efforts in several key areas such as legal and institutional reform, PFM strengthening, and improvements in local accountability and transparency. It also adds to the reform agenda, focusing specifically on local economic development and business climate reform, as well as introducing a systematic competency framework for career development and assessment at the local level. TA should be prioritized to support these new reform areas."

The project roads were constructed in good quality (average international roughness indices ranging between IRI 3–4)."
0,"At the government’s request and based on the project’s performance, ADB approved an additional financing of $27.73 million in 2012.5 The additional financing comprised a grant of 1 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Asian Development Fund Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Emergency Food Assistance Project. Manila.  5 ADB. 2012. Additional Cofinancing: Emergency Food Assistance Project in the Kingdom of Cambodia. Manila.  $24.5 million from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) 6 and a government contribution of $3.23 million. The project intervention rationale of providing one-off emergency countermeasures had evolved during implementation to include more medium-term activities addressing the structural constraints to increasing productivity. This logic was extended in the additional financing by (i) scaling up successful productivity enhancement and capacity-building measures, (ii) introducing new activities focused on improved nutrition and livelihoods, and (iii) improving food security warning systems. While the expected impact of the project with additional financing was left unchanged from the original project, its outcome was modified to ensure improved access to sufficient and nutritious food by households that lacked food security in the target provinces.7 Four of the seven existing project provinces and six new provinces were targeted by the additional financing.8 The revised project outputs with additional financing were as follows:"
1,The processing and implementation of three separate MFF tranches has proven to be administratively cumbersome and  inefficient  for  financing  a  four-year  investment  program.  A single $500 million project would not have incurred the construction delays that resulted from the need to process separate loans to finance construction in 2013 and 2014 (tranche 2) and in 2015 (tranche 3).
0,"Procurement. The PNG Resident Mission and ADB’s Pacific Department need to follow up on all recommendations of the PPRR of 2017 (para. 21, 22; footnote 9)."
1,"In this regard, the document preparation for land acquisition and resettlement should start much earlier than in this project. Resettlement consultants should be engaged at least 6 months before the scheduled start of civil works and require close coordination with the contractors preparing final design, and the time for their contract should cover the resettlement plan implementation period. Safeguard consultants should be recruited through a firm instead of on an individual basis as their frequent turnover or poor performance impacted the quality of reports and delayed activities."
0,"The performance of the executing agency is rated less than satisfactory. The DOW mostly managed project 1 in accordance with the facility administration manual. 21 However, its performance was curtailed when many trained government staff were lost to the private sector (including to the LNG mega project). Also, the PPRRs for both project 1 and project 2 revealed weak review, supervision, and monitoring of procurement processes (footnote 8 and para. 22). The PPRR referenced weak records management, weak financial management and project procurement capacity, unsubstantiated claims, erroneous evaluation of consultants leading to the hiring of an unqualified individual consultant, conflicts of interest, potentially favored firms, and poor project outputs."
1,"A mortgage market development also provides the opportunity of funding individual homeowner or homeowner association initiatives in providing affordable mortgages to improve the conditions of homes, gradual buildup of existing structures, and building new structures. Finally, the broader mortgage market should also consider household demand for home rentals."
0,"The effectivity of the EFRC in avoiding and minimizing impacts of road building was demonstrated by the project. Cutting of mountain slopes were minimized, construction of retaining wall on geologically fragile sections, minimization of box cuts to minimize soil disturbance, non- use of dozers and reliance on excavators and tippers allowed the immediate segregation of materials for re-use or disposal in approved sites. Use of log and rock barriers were effective in catching falling debris, stabilizing dump sites, and protecting the vegetation on the valley side which also helped prevent erosion. Controlled blasting was strictly implemented across all roads which minimized the destabilization of slopes including nearby areas. Close coordination with the local village officials also helped prevent accidents, such as in the case of a village along Durung Ri–Mikuri road where an entire village located below the road alignment was temporarily shifted."
1,"Technical support and training are crucial elements. Access to technical training was  the most appreciated aspect of the project after access to loans. The training provided those who  took out loans with the skills, knowledge, and capacity to apply good agriculture practices and  use latest technologies such as water-efficient irrigation systems and integrated pest  management, all of which resulted in high-quality produce. Farmers were confident to manage  their production systems with the new skills they learned and could access the follow-up technical  support provided."
0,"Road maintenance funds. Funds for routine maintenance (currently Nu109,000–115,000 per km per year for national highways) should be increased. The government should ensure adequate funding to maintain the project roads, including programming for resealing the bituminous surface, to refurbish the surface treatment and extend the service life of the roads."
0,"Tranche 1’s planned completion was September 2013. It was extended four times from original completion on 30 September 2013 to 30 September 2017, up to the MFF closing date. Delays occurred during the entire project cycle. Initial delays were attributed to poor project readiness at approval, which necessitated longer preparatory work in consultant recruitment, design, and procurement. Slow implementation of the Balloki Barrage and distribution system civil works caused further delays. The implementation period was initially extended to 30 September 2015, however, the first extension was not realistic because the completion date of two contracts (and one unawarded contract) fell after this date. In subsequent years, the project was extended three times for implementing slow civil works, and completing studies and design for additional subprojects under the PIAPPF. Final loan closing dates were 30 September 2017 (Loans 2299 and 3351) and 30 June 2017 (Loan 2300).

MPRDC’s headquarters is in Bhopal and a chief engineer there was in charge of project implementation. MPRDC, with the engagement of the supervision consultants, implemented all aspects of the project including project preparation and design, procurement and contract management, financial management and audit, construction supervision and quality control, safeguard measures, institutional strengthening, and loan covenant compliance. The Environmental and Social Cell at headquarters was responsible for ensuring compliance with the environmental and social safeguards of the project. The project roads were categorized under Bhopal and Jabalpur regions, depending on their geographical locations. Seven project implementation units (PIUs) were established in the field for project implementation (Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, Rewa, Sagar and Ujjain divisions). Each PIU was headed by a divisional manager, who was assisted by project managers and other staff as required. PIUs were delegated adequate technical and administrative authority for expeditious and field-level decisions. For matters having financial implications or affecting contracts’ milestones, the decisions were referred to MPRDC headquarters.

Project 1 included infrastructure rehabilitation, institutional reforms, on-farm water management and agricultural productivity, and improved groundwater management. The designs for projects 2 and 3 were simple and focused on infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrade. The MFF design and monitoring framework (DMF) was revised and updated in 2012 at tranche 3 approval.13 The program included improving PID project management efficiency and capacity as one of the projects 2 and 3 outputs. The DMF achievements are in Appendix 1. ADB and the government changed the selection, design, and sequencing of the projects based on the selection criteria under the framework financing agreement and prioritized New Khanki Barrage, Pakpattan Canal and Suleimanki Barrage over the Trimmu and Panjnad barrages and the Thal and Sidhnai canals, identified at appraisal."
0,"The MEF opened two first-generation imprest accounts at the National Bank of Cambodia, each with ceilings of 10% of the loan and grant amounts. The CPMU opened three accounts, one each for loan, grant, and counterpart funds, in ACLEDA Bank PLC, and two subaccounts, one for the grant and one for the counterpart funds, in the target provinces. Consistent with ADB’s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the project included quick- disbursing and retroactive financing features to facilitate urgent procurements. The statement of expenditure procedures applied were effective, apart from minor issues with processing some invoices. Although disbursements for rice distribution occurred in 2008, reduced seed procurement, a decrease in the contract amount for fertilizer in the 2010 wet season, and delays in the submission of the WFP annual report and accounting led to lower-than-expected disbursements during 2009 and 2011.

These interventions can contribute quite successfully to shrinking the credit gap, building the necessary capacity of participating financial institutions, and even generating employment in the SME sector. However, for financial intermediation loans and interventions to fulfill their objectives of contributing to overall economic growth and development, they should be complemented by policy-based operations that can help catalyze related and critical sectoral, policy, and institutional reforms."
0,"Activities under this subcomponent were fully integrated with the WTC rehabilitation to address water supply and sanitation problems for communities living along the canal. The subcomponent was implemented by the MOH and corresponding agencies at the district level in a timely manner between 2009 and 2014. MOH was able to reach 25 villages from the original target of 15 villages, covering three districts, along the WTC. In 2013, the Ministry of Environment (MOE) cancelled the civil works, equipment, and training allocation ($2.3 million) under Loan 2501. Loan savings ($1.5 million) from the MOE subcomponent was shifted to the MOH to expand to two additional districts in the upper CRB. Supported by the community facilitators, community groups were established to operate and maintain the built facilities.15 The facilitators were recruited through NGOs in each district. After 2 years of operation, most of the water supply facilities have doubled or tripled the number of customers. Several solid-waste recycling management facilities stopped their operations, mainly due to the high competition with the existing market for the recycled waste, which reduced the incentive for the community groups to maintain the operational cost of the facilities. This subcomponent delivered more outputs than expected at appraisal due to optimization and addition of the budget during implementation."
0,"The project expressway is an important transport corridor connecting HCMC and Dau Giay, which is a fast industrial developing area in southern Viet Nam, named Southern Focal Economic Area. Before the project, the traffic between HCMC to Vung Tau area (a famous tour attraction and port area) took mainly the National Highway 1 and National Highway 51 (NH-51), which is longer, in poor condition, and heavily congested. National Highway 1 is the main highway corridor in the country, which connects HCMC and Hanoi. Upon opening, a large amount of the traffic on the existing highways have diverted to the project expressway. On the new expressway, the vehicles now may drive at much faster speeds and with shorter distances."

This attests to the suitability of this financing modality for the type of investments required by a distribution asset operator. There are multiple projects to be financed with ever changing demand. The availability of the facility allows for subprojects that become ready or more urgent to be picked up by earlier tranches. In some cases, delays caused by technical challenges can be remedied by transferring the subproject to subsequent tranches."

For future projects, the DOR, in coordination with the National Land Commission (NLC), should ensure that affected landowners receive their ownership certificates in a timely manner and provide a timeline showing the necessary steps to secure ownership certificates. The DOR and NLC should arrange a focal person at the NLC for the project affected persons and provide contact information to the project affected persons."
0,"Increased cultivation productivity. This benefit stream is a function of two factors: physical cultivation area around WTC and cropping intensity. The appraisal assumes that cultivation area remains at 57,900 ha. However, between 2002 and 2016, physical cultivation area is actually declining at an average rate of 2% per year, from 58,331 to 48,730 ha. This is due to the conversion of agricultural land for other purposes. As land conversion is driven by macro-socioeconomic factors, this analysis assumes that cultivation area continues to decline with or without the project, and at an annual rate of 2% per year throughout the analytical timeframe."
0,"Being the first water resources sector project for which a project completion report has  been prepared since the resumption of ADB's operations in Viet Nam in 1993, the experience  gained under the Project is of particular relevance for follow-on water sector projects. Some of  the lessons learned from the Project have already been built in to the design of the SRRBSP.  However, several actions or activities should be undertaken to enhance the impact of the  Project, the SRRBSP, and other successor projects. If the Project is selected for postevaluation,  its output should be available in time so that it can provide an input to the midterm review of the  SRRBSP. The postevaluation should therefore be undertaken in early 2004."
1,"Strategic Studies for Future Engagements. ADB’s Country Partnership Strategy for India (2018–2022) envisages the possibility of its further engagements in MSME subsector. However, to be effective, it is necessary to set out clear strategy and perspectives of its effective engagement, possibly linking up with other related undertakings such as its assistance in strategic planning of economic corridors that is ongoing in several states. To this effect, a diagnostic study may be undertaken to assess the constraints of the MSME subsector covering its enabling environment, supply and demand side issues, and experience and lessons of existing programs in India and elsewhere. A clear operational perspective defined through such diagnostic study would be an essential requirement in further proceeding with sector project identification and engagement for this sector in India."

The government should analyze the reasons for these delays and develop practical measures to prevent recurrence of the same issues, including careful scheduling of project implementation, better contract management (such as ensuring timely claims and payments), and on-site monitoring of contractor performance. Subprojects with land donation issues might require a longer time to resolve; this could be identified during the subproject selection for the subsequent tranches under the investment program, for example."
0,"At the time of project appraisal poverty levels were reported to be increasing. As most people have land, they would be able to grow sufficient food to meet basic household consumption needs. However, wide discrepancies in the wellbeing of different segments of society were reported, particularly as livelihoods are increasingly linked to the cash economy. According to the 1996 household survey, 37% of the population was living below a poverty line of $350 (K461) per year. Furthermore, 17% of the population was unable to meet the basic food requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent. Poor economic performance and rapid population growth led to a sharp increase in the incidence of poverty to 53.8% in 2003. In the same period, poverty levels elsewhere in the Pacific region dropped from 15% in 1996 to 10% in 2003."

The Program targeted a road of regional significance and included components to improve cross-border movement of traffic. The remaining sections of the A380 highway are being improved under ongoing projects and this will continue under future projects planned by the government. Due to better road conditions and increased road capacity, the travel time on the project road and on the corridor overall was reduced with a five-fold increase in annual average daily traffic over the last 5 years. Future projects should plan similarly for integrated road sections on a corridor to achieve optimum regional economic impacts, instead of developing only isolated parts of a corridor."

0,"A planned total investment in the transmission and distribution subsectors of approximately ₹138 billion (approximately $3 billion at the exchange rate at the time) was indicated during MFF appraisal (for the period 2007-2012), reflecting an expectation of financing from non-ADB sources of approximately $2.4 billion. The balance sheets of the three DISCOMs grew by approximately ₹144 billion from the end of FY2007 to the end of FY2016, and that of Transco grew by approximately ₹35 billion over the same period. This indicates that the planned investment Facility was achieved, albeit over 8-9 years rather than 5 years. Despite this indication that actual investment met planned investment, the Design and Monitoring Framework (DMF) for the MFF shows that performance against targets was mixed. From a macroeconomic perspective, the design impact and was easily achieved - Gross State Product (GSP) growth averaged 8.5% over the period, compared to a target of at least 6%. The target to eliminate energy deficits by 2012 (from 13% in 2007) was not achieved, although the state did move to year-round capacity and energy surpluses from FY2015 (and this relates to investment in the generation subsector rather than the transmission and distribution subsectors). DMF targets for the transmission subsector were easily achieved (loss reduction, system capacity and system availability). However, the distribution subsector still shows signs of underinvestment; DMF loss targets (reflecting those set by MPERC) have not been achieved, and this under-recovery of generation costs materially impacts on the financial performance of the DISCOMs. Reliability and quality of supply have improved objectively (fewer outages, fewer customer complaints and 24 hours provided year-round to domestic consumers), but there is still further room for improvement. In this context, it is possible that the capital investment requirement for the distribution subsector was understated by the government at the time of appraisal, either as a consequence of an overly optimistic view of the capacity and condition of the (then) existing network or an under-estimation of demand for electricity (or both)."

These five roads were originally prepared under the earlier ADB- funded Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project.12 However, the cost estimates for these subproject roads, Mendi–Kandep and Laiagam–Porgera, prepared after the detailed engineering design was completed, exceeded the budget for road improvements under project 1. Therefore, the five roads prepared under the Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project could note be included.

The economic reevaluation focuses only on the fourth component—provision of PLCE courses—and the associated benefits from the increased earnings through either employment or self-employment of course completers in 29 districts of Bangladesh, as the economic benefits of the other components are difficult to quantify, given the available methodologies."
0,"In accordance with SPS and government policies on compensation, assistance, and resettlement, the implementation of the resettlement plans ensured that all affected people were compensated for their losses at replacement cost and proposed life rehabilitation methods to help them to improve or at least maintain living standards and income generation capability to the pre- project level. The compensation, assistance, and resettlement began in 2012 and was completed in 2016. Based on the updated resettlement plans and the data provided by the central project office (CPO) and provincial project management units (PPMUs), the total amount of compensation and assistance for affected households was roughly D269,310 million (equivalent to $11.864 million, assuming an exchange rate of $1 = D$22,700).

1,"The project has contributed to substantial improvements in the national and provincial S&R systems. As a result, nearly 100% of all disease outbreaks were reported to the respective MOH and the RCU within 24 hours, and investigated and responded to within 48 hours (i.e., Cambodia and Viet Nam achieved this in 100% of cases, while the Lao PDR did so in 84% of cases). The efficiency and reliability of the outbreak reporting system is a critical cornerstone of effective CDC. It relies on the technical judgment of frontline health workers to identify potentially important outbreaks, and to follow a standardized protocol to report and respond. Technical training for CDC staff; investment in capacity development, including formulation of guidelines, standards, and protocols; and the provision of necessary tools such as internet and phone call credits enabled this achievement. The project further mobilized support and institutionalized regional cooperation mechanisms for CDC such that various forms of cross-border activities were regularly planned and organized. The CLV countries shared the responsibility of organizing cross- border information exchange and other joint activities, and actively participated in such activities regularly. The frontline defense against communicable diseases was strengthened through improved hygiene and better prevention in the villages, as demonstrated in the MHVs. Lastly, the malaria incidence in all targeted provinces declined dramatically as a result of delivering targeted interventions supported by the additional financing and other development partners. 16 APSED was updated in 2017 to include public health emergency preparedness (WHO. 2017.

Project Impact:	Increased number of school graduates and teachers including trainees, with improved knowledge and skills education service delivery. Comments/ Remarks: The project was successful in increasing the participation of females and ethnic minority students. It was also successful in researching and then implementing a range of strategies that have resulted in improved participation and achievement. These strategies are now being made available and used in non-project provinces, as they also wish to improve performance in these important areas. As a range of MOET offices were also involved in the research and materials development, the learning from the project has become embedded into a range of MOET operations."

For establishing the regional network, an implementation and operational framework, in the form of multilateral and bilateral agreements, was reached among and between SASEC countries. As designed at appraisal, all SASEC countries selected a service agency that was an eligible service provider in their respective country, responsible for operating the SASEC regional network jointly with the service agencies in other countries. For in-country implementation of the regional network, MOUs were signed between the respective executing and service agencies. The operation of the village network was to be franchised to private entrepreneurs among rural ISPs or nongovernment organizations, selected by local communities. For the SASECRTN, service agencies in each country were selected from capable ICT research institutes to design and conduct research and provide training for ICT professional development. At appraisal, it was envisaged that 12 in- country service agency agreements would be signed, each one by the executing agency and service agency for each of the three project networks."
0,"The MFF and project 3 are rated relevant to the government’s development objectives and ADB’s country and sector strategies, both at appraisal and completion (para. 6). Though the MFF predated ADB’s Strategy 2020, its road map, policy framework, and undertakings continue to be aligned with and relevant to Strategy 2020, with their focus on provision of safe and effective water and sanitation services.26 The MFF and project 3 are aligned with ADB’s Water Operational Plan, 2011–2020.27 At completion, the MFF and project 3 remain relevant to ADB’s policy focus on India in areas of inclusive growth, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability.28 The MFF sector strategy and policy matrix defined under project 3 are aligned with the government’s successive 5-year plans, NITI Aayog’s 3-year action agenda (2017–18 to 2019–20) and GOR’s 12th plan, which prioritized supply of potable water and urban poverty alleviation. 29 The processing of project 3 as a sector loan and the MFF were relevant and in response to the agenda 26 ADB. 2008.

The results chain was sound for the MFF and its individual projects though the performance indicators varied between the projects (para. 9). The MFF, including project 3, introduced wastewater services in hitherto uncovered towns and was instrumental in inducing awareness and raising community demand for such services. Landfills could not be undertaken because of factors outside project control (para. 15 and footnote 10). The firefighting component was included during project 3 appraisal based on ULBs’ needs reassessment, enhancing the relevance of project 3 and the MFF, though the facility DMF was not updated to reflect the same (paras. 9 and 20)."

Upon completion of the project, the connectivity and mobility in the project areas had been substantially improved (para. ), which has brought huge socioeconomic benefits to local people (para. ). The project carried out socioeconomic surveys in 2016–2017 (with data in 2014 and 2016). Generally, the benefits of such expressways expand rapidly after 2–3 years of operation. A follow-up survey is needed to assess the impacts and recommend government interventions, which may maximize and accelerate the socioeconomic benefits, especially to the poor."
0,"Overall, the project is rated successful. It was appropriate to the government’s development strategy and ADB’s country strategy and program and remained so at completion. The project is rated less than effective due to partial achievement of the planned outcomes.

1,"Further action or follow-up. While six state-owned banks administer the bulk of government-supported funding, the remaining 22 banks in Uzbekistan do not offer a significant amount of mortgage lending. To expand mortgage lending offerings, the government may wish to establish a dedicated wholesale mortgage financial institution under the auspices of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) or the Ministry of Finance, which offers long-term funding on comparable terms to all banks. Such institution can play a leading role in developing the market through issuing unsecured and subsequently mortgage-backed bonds and contractual deposits to fund the banks’ mortgage business. It can also play an important role to establish and subsequently improve the banks’ mortgage lending processes and monitoring through dedicated training. There are interesting examples globally such as in Eastern Europe, Mexico, and Chile, but also in the region (Kazakhstan and Armenia) that highlight the benefits of establishing a wholesale mortgage financial institution. Its build-up could be supported in parallel with the existing mortgage lenders improving their mortgage business. The possible privatization of Ipoteka Bank might fit well with such strategy. A survey to gauge all banks’ interest in mortgage lending via the Bankers’ Association would be useful to ensure the necessary buy-in."

VEC with the assistance of the PSC carefully supervised the RP implementation. The advance funds were transferred to the SGIAs for the five related districts. An external monitory agency was engaged in 2010 to carry out periodical monitoring of the RP implementation and prepare quarterly monitoring reports. For the added section (first 4 km), the RP was prepared in 2010, implementation of which was totally financed by HCMC. The compensation to affected households took place in 2009 and 2010 for the households located along the original expressway sections (51 km) and in 2012 for the added section. By the end of 2013, handover of land to the contractors for all expressway sections was completed. An income restoration program was implemented by focusing on vocational trainings, agricultural models, and industrial/business extension model for severely affected and vulnerable households. Upon completion, a total of 446.3 hectares of land was acquired with a total of 2,043 households affected, among which 2,032 households received compensation payment (amounting to 99.5%).2 2,043 households handed-over land (amounting to 100%) and 303 households were allocated plots in the resettlement site, while 171 households self-relocated. Among the affected households, 1,044 households were severely affected (losing 10% or more of their productive assets) and 150 households were identified as vulnerable households and received additional assistance in line with project resettlement policy. Complaints have been resolved using the grievance redress procedures, mostly at the district level. There are two pending complaints, one of which is waiting for the court’s decision. These and proposed follow-up actions are summarized in Appendix 16. The external monitoring agency carried out a mid-term review in June 2011 to assess post-resettlement living standards of all affected households, which concluded that the living conditions of most affected household had stabilized or improved. The final resettlement completion report was prepared by the executing agency in January 2015.3 The monitoring and evaluation report on the RP implementation and life rehabilitation was prepared by the external monitor in March 2017.4 A total of 13 social safeguard monitoring reports prepared by the external monitor were disclosed on the ADB website. 5 Internal monitoring was carried out by VEC, 2 Some HHs still didn’t receive compensation for the following reasons: i) local agencies need to verify and identify exact owners; ii) there are some disputes on land; iii) some HHs cannot provide LURC because they gave their LURC as guarantee to a bank to get a loan; and iv) some owners cannot be reached or are unknown.

0,"The project’s development impact is rated satisfactory. At appraisal, a project impact assessment focused on poverty, gender, LAR, indigenous people, health and labor. Accordingly, a design and monitoring framework and a project performance monitoring and evaluation program were designed as part of the project appraisal document. During implementation, the PSC carried out a baseline survey in 2012 and a completion survey in 2017. A comparison of the indicators before and after the project found that (i) the monthly average income per capita increased by 9% per year for HCMC and 17% per year for Dong Nai Province; (ii) the GDP per capita in 2017 reached $6,119 for HCMC, an increase of 8.5%, and $4,545 for Dong Nai Province, an increase of 9%; (iii) the poverty rates fell from 0.3% to 0.01% for HCMC and from 3.7% to 1.2% for Dong Nai Province; (iv) the export value at HCMC port increased about 700 times in 2010–2014; (v) the number of businesses increased by 50% for HCMC and 23% for Dong Nai Province; (vi) the traffic in the project areas sharply increased, including on the project expressway; and (vii) the traffic accidents in the project areas and on the expressway, however, were still significant (Appendix 15)."

1,"Alignment of activities that are on a critical path. Climate change adaption support was important because of its expected capacity development benefits and, more so, because of its role in rendering the project roads resilient to climate change risks. To achieve this result, climate activities should have been more closely aligned with preconstruction activities, i.e., the engineering of the roads. Had ADB administered the NDF grant directly, consultant inputs might have been timely and better coordinated. Climate change adaptation was critical to ensure that the project roads were designed to withstand future climate impacts. This should have been planned and reflected in work plans listing critical activities in a functional sequence."
0,"Given the government’s strong commitment to developing SMEs, ADB should continue to support the development of MSMEs in Armenia. However, given the sufficient liquidity currently available in the Armenian financial market (para. 38), ADB’s succeeding MSME support interventions should support a shift towards higher value - added economy with a focus on the promotion of new knowledge and advanced practices. For example, efforts could focus on supporting export promotion (to seize trade opportunities triggered by Armenia joining the Eurasian Economic Union) or promoting green finance (such as environmentally sustainable agriculture). Introduction of new loan products under ADB programs (e.g. women-tailored MSME loans) should be supported by piggy-backed TA as often PFIs lack required expertise (para 49)."

1,"The sustainability of the gains made by the project is likely to be maintained as the project worked closely with MOET, the departments of education and training (or DOETs) in the provinces, and local communities, as well as local schools. In this way, the project provided a focus that was shared by the government and all education authorities, which, in turn, enabled the policies and programs to be continued and applied nationwide.5 The project helped raise awareness of the importance of gender and ethnic equity among managers, teachers, and students. This will continue beyond the life of the project and promote the more extensive use of the successful strategies developed under the project. The five research studies conducted under Output 3 provided a basis for replication or upscaling of the actions undertaken under this project. As it is, the Prime Minister has already implemented Decision No. 36/2013 /QD-Ttg dated 18 June 2013 establishing the policy of providing semi-boarding accommodation for students of LSSs in especially difficult socio-economic conditions, resulting from the pilot innovations under Output 3 of this project."
1,"Land Acquisition. The project acquired a strip of land to accommodate the design width of the road. During implementation, any minor change in the road alignment required a long process of consultations, resettlement plan revisions, and land acquisition, leading to implementation delays. This could have been avoided by acquiring a fixed width (corridor) based on the declared right of way or defined corridor of impact. This will also improve the quality of the DOR’s records on available land for future projects."

The gross state domestic product for Madhya Pradesh grew at an average rate of 8.5% per annum between 2008 and 2012, compared to the DMF target of 6%. The enhanced distribution capacity and reliability facilitated (i) higher productivity of agricultural outputs; (ii) decreased energy costs due to better efficiencies and lower maintenance costs of electric appliances, irrigation pumps, and equipment, which in turn improved the economic opportunities of farmers, industrial and commercial users, and domestic consumers; and (iii) a reduction in the deficit between electricity supply and demand (a surplus was achieved in 2015, 3 years later than the DMF target of 2012)."
0,"At appraisal, the envisaged project comprised construction of approximately 51 kilometers (km) of four-lane, tolled expressway, starting at the Second Ring Road in HCMC District 9 and ending at National Highway 1 at Dau Giay, Dong Nai Province. The expressway would directly connect the center of HCMC to economic growth areas in the provinces and north of HCMC along National Highway 1. The investment cost of the project was estimated at $932.4 million equivalent, to be financed by a loan of $410.2 million from ADB, a loan of ¥50.972 billion (about $517.6 million equivalent) from the Government of Japan through the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)—now the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)—and a government fund of $4.6 million equivalent."
0,"Food for Work Scheme. The Food for Work (FFW) scheme was designed to rehabilitate rural roads and tertiary canals to support (i) better and efficient linking of farms to markets, villages to public services, etc., (ii) more irrigated land - contributing significantly to agriculture productivity; and, (iii) creating employment opportunities for food-insecure households whereby their labor for rehabilitation of infrastructure was compensated through food (rice). FFW sub-projects were mostly manual labor-based rehabilitation of rural roads and tertiary canals. The project provided a grant to the World Food Programme (WFP) to implement the FFW scheme for two crop years (2008-09 and 2009-10) in 4 project target provinces - Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. A total of 154 FFW subprojects were implemented, rehabilitating 209.97 km of rural roads and 4.61 km of dug canals. The scheme engaged 19,667 beneficiary households (including 6,453 female-headed households), and generated 629,715 labor days of work. A total of 3,306 tons of rice was distributed to labor for rehabilitating and improving the rural roads and dug canals. Occasional, but very minor, issues arose with affected households and safeguard screening was strengthened in implementation to address this. Overall output achievements exceeded appraisal estimates."
1,"Maintain solid coordination and efficiency. ADB should continue to closely coordinate with its clients, especially for new procurement and other project implementation arrangements; and adhere to the principles of integrity, efficiency, and economy while being open to innovative solutions. The MOF, Uzbekenergo, and the solar energy stakeholders across various levels valued the efforts of the ADB headquarters and the Uzbekistan Resident Mission to respond to technical clarifications and resolve procurement issues to keep the project on track."
1,"Further, sound preparation of the core subprojects demonstrated a replicable model that enabled subsequent subprojects to be prepared and processed efficiently, to have contracts awarded and progress payments made, and to be completed on schedule. Advanced procurement was used effectively and contributed to smooth implementation. Future assistance for similar projects should encourage executing agencies to replicate these good practices."
1,"Modality. Given ADB’s experience with this program and other policy-based loans in the Pacific, ADB should consider more closely the option of a stand-alone policy-based grant and loan modality as opposed to the programmatic approach when financing policy-based programs in Pacific DMCs (para. 30). In Pacific DMCs, one must take into account: (i) the volatility of politics and frequent turnover of governments, especially in Melanesia; and (ii) the nascent nature of party and policy politics."

This component was to finance the infrastructure investment in the sub-projects in the three target zones, with two sub-zones in each zone having an integrated package of water supply and management support. The first three sub-projects were identified at appraisal with detailed sub- project appraisal reports covering technical, hydraulic, social, environmental, and safeguard aspects). An additional three sub-zones (within these zones) were to be identified during implementation. It was expected that the sub-zones would cover approximately 26% of Dili’s customers."
1,"ADB should consider promoting increased financial sector penetration through continuing support of electronic financial services. One of the factors explaining currently high interest rates on loans is the time and effort required for financial intermediaries to reach customers and check their creditworthiness. Introduction of electronic signatures and access by lenders to the databases of the major government agencies (e.g., the Tax Service, the Social Fund, and state utilities companies) would reduce loan processing costs and, hence, loan interest rates. Another area for ADB intervention would be developing the capital markets as an alternative source of financing. At present, this market does not exist because of significant regulatory and nonregulatory barriers."

0,"Cash for Work Scheme (including Civil Works contracts). The Cash for Work (CFW) scheme - including civil work (CW) contracts - was designed (following the Major Change of Scope) in 2009 to rehabilitate rural roads and tertiary canals with the same objectives as those under the FFW scheme, with the exception that food-insecure households engaged for rehabilitation of infrastructure were compensated through cash for their labor. CFW was initiated to assist poor households to have immediate cash to support annual incomes and food security. The CFW subprojects were mostly manual labor-based rehabilitation of rural roads and tertiary canals, whereas the civil works (CW) contracts mostly applied machinery-based rehabilitation. 6 ECLCs (under the auspices of the Ministry of Women Affairs (MOWA) were established and operational only in Kampong Thom and Otdar Meanchey during the project implementation. 7 RGC was implementing a cash scholarship program called Program Budgeting (PB) for grade 7-9. The cash entitlement was $45/student/year. World Bank was also supporting a cash scholarship program (CEESP) for grade 7-9 and the cash entitlement was $45/student/year and $60/student/year, depending on poverty and merit level. Demand for CFW subprojects was generally high throughout the target provinces, except in parts of Battambang (where there were both difficult soils and also other, non-project, employment opportunities available).8 Because the project was financed with mixed grant and loan funds, the financing agreement was amended to allow for the additional CFW subprojects."

The passenger time cost was derived from the gross domestic product per capita of HCMC and Dong Nai Province in 2017. Other factors taken into account in the calculation of the passenger travel time cost savings included average vehicle loads, percentage of work-related trips, time costs by different road users, and potential increases in time cost. It was assumed that the induced traffic was 20% of the total traffic. Half of the benefits were included for the induced traffic. The reevaluation of the benefits indicates that the VOC savings initially took around 73.1% of the total benefits in 2017 (first fully operation year), but the share of the passenger time cost benefits increased sharply along with fast economic development and income increase, to 36.5% in 2030. 1 ADB.

For the first group of type 1 beneficiaries, the difference is assumed to be 40%, or $642/worker/year. For the second group of type 1 beneficiaries, the difference is assumed to be one-fifth of the difference for the first group, or $128/worker/year. This is multiplied by the number of type 1 beneficiaries by group, projected over a period of 25 years, and adjusted by an SCF of 0.9 to arrive at the economic benefits from future earnings of employed type 1 beneficiaries.

In the with-project case, new roads were constructed. The project roads enable much shorter travel distances than in the without-project case, which required the use of roads in India. The new roads also reduce travel times for local farmers to access nearby towns and markets to sell their agriculture products and enable the community to access a variety of social services. Traffic analysis compared the actual traffic counts on the project roads with those estimated at appraisal. The traffic forecast for future years was also revised accordingly. Economic benefits were calculated by comparing the with-project and without-project cases. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was recalculated and sensitivities were tested for the project."

0,"Regulated revenue from new assets. As noted above, most of the incremental revenue earned by DISCOMs for the new distribution facilities is calculated in accordance with regulations set by MPERC. MPERC allows DISCOMs to recover electricity purchase costs, interest costs, depreciation charges, O&M costs, working capital charges and corporate taxes in end-use tariffs.1 A return on invested equity of 16% (post-tax) is also included in the annual revenue allowance. Any assets that are brought in to service are added to companies’ regulatory asset base, and this results in increases in revenue allowances for return on equity, depreciation and interest costs. 1 The annual revenue requirement (ARR) is the total electricity revenue that the jurisdictional regulator has agreed to allow the electricity distributor to recover during the subsequent year. The tariff that is subsequently calculated is just the mean by which the ARR is recovered from customers. The DISCOMs are not incentivized to under-forecast sales quantity (and thereby increase tariff) because over-recovery of revenue (compared to the ARR) is recovered in subsequent years (by way of a reduction in ARR)."

0,"ADB disbursements from ordinary capital resources totaled $543.47 million (87.7%) out of the original loan amount of $620 million.24 An imprest account was extended to the TRANSCO portion but later discontinued as other methods of payment, e.g., direct payment and reimbursement, were found suitable for all the projects. Cancellations of $4.25 million (project 2), $15.85 million (project 4), and $14.00 million (project 5) were made, and the last cancellation of $17.98 million was made on 22 July 2015, before loan closure. These cancellations reflected the lower than expected loan utilization due to the reasons mentioned in para. 20. While the MFF does not include expected disbursements, the individual loan projects had disbursements projected during the initial loan start-up mission and updated annually during the tripartite reviews, which were chaired by representatives of the Government of India. The loan projects generally followed the projected disbursements, although with about a 1-year delay compared to expectations at loan appraisal reflecting the time required for the procurement of the ICB contractors. This delay resulted from the fact that the PFRs were prepared based on general information about the conditions of the existing distribution systems, rather than on elaborate system designs. The designs were not firmed up until after ADB had approved the related loan"

The answer by the majority was that the poverty levels were “average”, both during the baseline study as well as during the recent impact study. Food self- sufficiency was also assessed as little different today when compared with the baseline study before the Project 1 project. The average monthly household income was assessed as much the same (baseline and recent impact) in the project-impacted village and to have substantially fallen in the case of the control village. 24 Government of Papua New Guinea (2012) Papua New Guinea Poverty Profile.

0,"The nutrition and health training got off to a slow start; PLAN International and its partner local NGOs1 implementing the activities were unfamiliar with RGC and ADB procedures and formats and needed further time to develop measures to ensure the sustainability of interventions. In late-2014, the health and nutrition/hygiene training had progressed well, although gardening and cooking demonstrations had been slow to progress – apparently in the face of beneficiary disinterest. The PLAN International contract was extended (no-cost basis) to March 2015 to allow more time for completion of its activities, together with follow-up monitoring to promote likely sustainability. The nutrition and sanitation activities were completed by the time of the ADB April 2015 review mission, although final coverage was less than had been planned."

ADB agreed to the reallocation of $1.25m of the remaining unutilized balance to finance some of the remaining CFW and CW proposals. By late-2014 the CFW activities had been completed (including cash payments to beneficiaries), and the originally-expected volume of CW likewise completed. However, 12 CW contracts to laterite roads used cash collected from seed and fertilizer sales and their defect liability periods were going to extend beyond then-expected project life (i.e., June 2015).

The project delivered the following results:"
1,"At appraisal, it is recommended that greater attention given to assessing the capacity of implementing agencies to effectively manage complex projects, regardless of the project’s size and budget. This is particularly true for entities that are relatively new, have limited institutional experience, and/or are dependent on the government for operational budgets. Large teams of consultants do not necessarily compensate for inadequate institutional capacity. It is further recommended that ADB pay attention to understand how procurement packaging and expected contract values can impact the speed with which executing and implementing agencies can obtain the requisite approvals."

All the PFIs decided to provide only C category subloans. Until the solution was found, there were no disbursements made."
1,"Advance actions were one of the measures to reduce project startup delay. However, there seems to be inadequate clarity on implementing advance actions in the government rules, and a good mechanism to make the subproject civil works ready for execution before or right after the project becomes effective. Currently, government control over the provincial debt ceiling and implementation of relevant budget management policies also contribute to startup delays and, therefore, limit project readiness."

1,"Different understanding of price adjustment by the government. Under ADB procurement guidelines, civil works contracts exceeding 18 months shall include a price adjustment. National regulation is not harmonized with the standard conditions of contract established by the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC), and the concept of price adjustment is not understood well by the authorities. Accordingly, the executing agencies of large-scale infrastructure projects in Kazakhstan decided on contracts’ duration not exceeding 18 months to avoid the price adjustment. The Shymkent–Tashkent road project was designed to be completed within 18 calendar months; however, even disregarding the long winter breaks, construction would require much longer than 18 months. Compression of the works program to fit the 18-month contractual period could have potentially contributed to a lower quality of works."

0,"In the economic analysis at completion, the annual operation and maintenance costs for both the optical fiber and operation and maintenance costs for other equipment are estimated as 2% of its installation cost, largely following the assumptions of the original economic analysis. The fiber optic cable is presumed to have service life exceeding the economic analysis period. Other equipment such as routers, switches, computers, peering equipment are presumed to have service life ranging from 5 to 9 years, after which they require replacement for a few parts or the entire equipment. Thus, a periodic maintenance cost of 5% of the cost is introduced in the analysis at completion while no residual value for the equipment is considered in the analysis. Detailed breakdown of costs from the governments was not made available. Therefore, for the purpose of the current economic analysis, the taxes and duties are assumed to be 25% of the cost financed by the respective governments and are excluded from this analysis. At completion, the information on project-related imports and tradeable and/or non-tradeable items was not available since information on the disaggregated costs by expenditure items was not made available by the Governments.

These included 60 civil works contract packages amounting to $5.91 million; 382 CFW rural infrastructure rehabilitations totaling $3.90 million; 21 goods contracts totaling $6.43 million; and a service-provider contract with Plan International for $3.96 million, which used quality- and cost-based selection criteria, individual consultant selection for the implementation consultants, and consultants’ qualifications selection for the evaluation entity.31 Contractors’ and suppliers’ performance was satisfactory. Overall, CPMU’s procurement practices were adequate and did not cause implementation delays."

1,"Need for a sustainable road maintenance regime. The poor conditions of provincial roads in the project areas (other than those rehabilitated under the project) points to an urgent need to improve the provincial road asset maintenance system. The lack of a proper road asset management system renders allocations to O&M susceptible to inaccurate budgeting. Moreover, as reflected in their response to landslides, provincial governments substitute regular preventive maintenance with capital-intensive rehabilitation and reconstruction (para. 39). This pattern is a waste of resources, as the savings gained by skipping routine maintenance are dwarfed by the additional capital cost involved in periodic rehabilitation or reconstruction.24 Achieving an optimal balance between O&M and road investments is the remit of a systematic road asset management system, which the provinces should adopt."

Too many small consulting services packages (19 in total with 11 small-scale construction supervision packages) were included in the original procurement plan, resulting in protracted recruitment.11 QCBS method with time-based contract took too long to recruit consultants for straight-forward and small-scale civil works construction supervision. Consultants’ qualifications selection method (CQS) with lump- sum contract was used for construction supervision consultants, allowing faster recruitment, though not always the best suited method. In retrospect, it was unclear that a QCBS equivalent method was available in the government policy. Fixed budget selection with bio-data technical proposal and lump sum contract would have been more appropriate where (i) content, duration of services, and the required outputs of the consultants are clearly defined; and (ii) there are few external risks such that firms could accurately predict the inputs required for the assignment."

1,"Project implementation. On the part of ADB, the project provided the chance to fully understand how Turkmenistan’s internal regulations and legislation affect project preparation and implementation. On the part of the executing agency, a key lesson involves the need for dedicated staff to be available for projects financed by international financing institutions such as ADB. This was not the case for the project, often resulting in scheduling conflicts between multiple assignments and lack of focus on project requirements. Agencies outside of the MRT had limited knowledge of ADB guidelines and procedures and were not sensitive to project schedules, often resulting in delays in implementation.

Going forward, the sustainability of road projects in PNG will depend on the capacity of the NRA, or its successor, and on the existence of sufficient funds for road maintenance. According to the project design, improving the capacity and effectiveness of the NRA will be critical to ensuring the success of the overall investment program. Although the government failed to sufficiently top up the road user fund during project 1, the government provided budget support to the DOW for road maintenance. The government has also passed policies that demonstrate its commitment to ensuring the future operation and maintenance of project roads. The government, together with its development partners (including ADB, Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the European Union) is examining how it can strengthen institutional arrangements to sustainably manage all national and provincial roads. This includes a review of the organizational future of the NRA. The core function of the NRA is to maintain more than 2,000 km of priority national and provincial roads.

While Sowatco and Vinatex had both already equitized before participating in the MFF, Song Da was working toward equitization with an original target date of 2015. However, cumbersome processes and slow decision-making delayed Song Da’s equitization until December 2017. Moreover, once its valuation was established, Song Da could not implement any further corporate or financial activities that would impact its valuation. The majority ownership that the government retained in Song Da made its IPO less attractive to investors.

Despite advance procurement action initiated in February 2009, the construction works for the Bekasi Syphon began only in June 2010. Due to additional works necessitated by landslides and floods, the Bekasi syphon works were not completed until June 2015 (60 months of construction, from the original plan of 29 months). Bekasi syphon construction improved the water quality of the supplied bulk water for Jakarta. The main work under this subcomponent was the rehabilitation of WTC, through two civil works packages. Those works have experienced significant delays. The recruitment of the consultants to prepare the DED took longer than expected at the project appraisal stage. Furthermore, it took about 24 months for the government to issue a decree for the provision of compensation to the affected people to comply with the agreements set in the resettlement framework.

For social safeguards, although the DDR was prepared at appraisal and implemented by NPT, it wasn’t disclosed on the ADB website. It was only disclosed in 2014 when the design consultants conducted the detailed land acquisition and resettlement survey and prepared the DDRs reflecting an updated socioeconomic profile of the affected districts and communes. For other 220 kV transmission lines, civil works commenced before the resettlement plans were updated."

The contract was signed on 26 March 2012 and the consultants started work on 10 April 2012. They carried out all activities in accordance with the terms of reference (TOR). The major outputs of the TA were a comprehensive Road Safety Improvement Program; a conceptual plan for the Road Accident Reporting, Analysis, and Monitoring System; development of an Accident Response System; identification of PPP corridors and suggestions for expanding private sector participation; and a State Highway Development Plan. During implementation, based on a request by MPRDC, an international insurance expert was also recruited to help them explore the feasibility of insurance coverage for road accident victims in the state. The contract with the insurance expert was signed on 16 December 2013 and the TA completion date was extended to enable completion of this additional activity. When the TA was completed in March 2014, it had realized its objectives of assisting the government in strengthening the capacity of MPRDC in road safety management and expanding private sector participation in road network development and maintenance.

1,"The financial forecast analysis makes a few key assumptions, based on data collected from some of the project vocational colleges. First, that the average tuition fee collected by the project vocational colleges will rise by 15% per year due to increased number of students and higher tuition rates that they can charge from improved quality of training. In addition, other operating revenues, such as from service contracts and short-term training, are likewise expected to rise by 10% per year as a result of improved partnership with private enterprises and increased demand for service contracts due to the availability of modern equipment. The level of state budget is assumed to be fixed at the 2018 level from 2019 onwards to reflect the government’s plan to increase the fiscal autonomy of public vocational colleges. Staffing costs are assumed to increase by 8% per year, which is about 5 percentage points higher than expected inflation to reflect increasing salaries for teachers and staff. Maintenance costs are assumed to increase 10% per year in line with increased enrollment, while other operating costs are expected to rise 5% per year."

1,"Currently, the government and IFIs provide loans with a 15-year tenor to fund mortgages in Uzbekistan. To augment limited government and IFI resources, mortgage-issuing banks or a dedicated mortgage wholesale bank may issue bonds beginning with a medium-term maturity (of up to 5 years). As the banks grow their mortgage loan book, they can gradually introduce mortgage-backed bonds to fund longer tenors. The increasing tenor for funding (beyond 15 years) substantially improves the ability of low-income households to participate in mortgage borrowing. In addition to unsecured and mortgage-backed bonds, it is meaningful that households can participate in long-term contractual savings programs to collect the necessary equity for funding a home. Such savings programs may be offered by the banks or a dedicated mortgage wholesale financial institution."

A key feature of the GAP was empowering health workers, both staff and volunteers, and using evidence-based data to influence the design and planning of the gender responsiveness of the government’s CDC program in targeted districts and provinces. For instance, baseline and post evaluation surveys and demographic assessments with age and sex- disaggregated data helped shape communicable disease surveillance and response systems and contributed to developing model healthy villages (MHVs). Case study 3: Kao Tho Kayeng (CDC Staff in Preak Srey, Kok Thom district, Kandal province). At 58 years old, Ms. Kayeng has experienced first-hand how health services have evolved having worked in the hospital since 1980. She attended and graduated from the midwifery course, delivered births, and performed office work in the hospital. One of the positive changes is the proper reporting of incidences of communicable diseases. She used to do this work manually and it was time-consuming. Since the new improvements has been made, she regularly updates the data in the system using the computer and her mobile phone. Her job of administering vaccines and distributing medicines have been complemented with trainings on various health topics like preventive care for children, diagnosing diseases, reporting CDC cases using the smart phone. After attending the trainings, she has a much better understanding and appreciation of the proper recording of data, with relevant disaggregation by sex and age. She fully understands that data is used for assessment, planning, programming, and setting-up surveillance and response systems, and protocols for life and death situations. The modern improvements have now made data recording easier and efficient. This helped Ms. Kayeng save time and gain confidence in her job, allowing her to do more productive tasks at work and at home. She is able to fulfill her multiple roles as a health worker/midwife, mother, and grandmother."

1,"Incremental recurrent costs. Incremental recurrent costs refer to the additional maintenance and operating costs as well as other costs that will be incurred because of the additional students. For example, the higher number of students will impose additional wear and tear on the training equipment. The incremental recurrent cost incurred under the project is estimated based on an upper bound on fees paid by TVET students—D5 million per year for 3 years, or VND15 million (equivalent to $665) multiplied by the incremental number of TVET students projected for the selected schools. This assumes that what students pay in fees should roughly cover their costs to the school. For short-term trainees, the recurrent costs is estimated at 10% of the recurrent costs for college-level students. The recurrent cost is expected to have a total economic value of $144.6 million from 2011 to 2038."

Goods, works, and equipment were procured in accordance with the procurement plan and ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Community packages were procured in line with procedures agreed upon in the project administration memorandum (PAM). Seven consultant packages were recruited, and three civil works packages procured for PFR1. The consulting services package under the MOA subcomponent was cancelled due to the MOA’s decision to implement activities without consultant support. The following consulting services experienced significant delays in recruitment: (i) under BBWSC, the DED consultant for the WTC rehabilitation was delayed by 1 year. This was due to the long contract negotiation process between the first-ranked firm and the government. The contract was awarded to the second- ranked firm in 2010, 1 year after the project’s effective date, despite the advance procurement action; and (ii) the recruitment of the consulting services package under the MOE sub- component was delayed for 4 years. 18 This was mainly due to slow decision making, unfamiliarity with ADB procurement guidelines, and the recurring changes of the consultant terms of reference. The delayed recruitment of the WTC DED and civil works supervision consultant negatively affected the WTC rehabilitation, as the DED was accordingly delayed. Two civil works packages were procured through international competitive bidding and one civil works package was procured through the national competitive bidding. For all civil works packages, evaluation of bids took longer than expected due to several ADB comments to be clarified."

The undisbursed amount of $5.68 under Loan A includes $1.60 million allocated for two additional equipment contracts, but procurement could not be completed before loan closing, and the rest are savings. In retrospect, the disbursement projections were unrealistic at the time of effectiveness, as they did not consider the PMU’s limited capacity for procurement at that time.19 The annual audited project financial statements (APFS) of Loan A and Loan B were generally in order and were issued an unqualified opinion by the auditor except for fiscal year 2014 when a qualified opinion was issued.20 The final APFS was consistent with ADB’s Loan Financial Information System figures."

0,"The program is rated efficient. The economic analysis takes the approach adopted at appraisal and factors in changes in the situation, delays, and costs variations.27 In the case of the three barrages (projects 1 to 3), the analysis assumed that without the project the barrages would fail at some stage in the future, thereby resulting in lost agricultural income over the following several years plus incur the additional capital and operating costs necessary to provide a temporary structure to restore irrigation supplies. The rehabilitation and upgrade of the barrages will not increase agricultural production or productivity, with the primary benefit being the elimination of the income foregone associated with failure. Similarly, in the case of Pakpattan Canal (project 3), it was assumed that the project would avoid the risk of failure associated with the poor condition and the associated loses due to limited irrigation supplies until restoration."

The MFF modality was an appropriate financing instrument, offering an opportunity for long-term engagement, but poor project readiness, short project duration and high reforms targets made the design complex and ambitious. During implementation, changes in the approach to institutional strengthening improved project design relevance and ensured harmony with other devolved systems in canal command areas. Engineering design changes enhanced flood resilience and irrigation conveyance efficiencies. The PIAPPF’s scope increased, with $1.7 billion worth of projects prepared.

Therefore, the executing agency, the Ministry of Information and Communication (MOIC), chose to procure necessary equipment, instead of the fiber cable itself, to be installed to the existing cable links between Thimphu and Phuentsholing, as well as Thimphu and Gelephu. Together with the access gateway established in Thimphu, and two border gateways with CLSs in Phuentsholing and Gelephu, the regional network component in Bhutan was handed over to the service agency, Bhutan Telecom, for operation and maintenance (O&M) upon completion in July 2014, in accordance with the service agency agreement. However, although internet service providers (ISPs) in Bhutan were solicited for utilization of the regional network, none of them showed interest as it was not commercially attractive. This prompted MOIC to highlight the weak linkages between the project and its stated economic objectives, and request ADB for approval to use the regional network for research and education purposes.14 Thus, the regional network in Bhutan was redefined as the Druk Research & Education Network (DrukREN), which expanded the fiber-optic network to 23 higher education institutions and hospitals in the country and provided them with internet connection to connect to similar institutions in SASEC."

In addition to the civil works contracts, two consulting services contracts were planned, finalized, and awarded: one for project support and one for construction and maintenance supervision. Signed civil works and consulting services contracts were conducted as planned. Procurement of the civil works packages was carried out in accordance with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). However, ADB’s project procurement-related reviews (PPRRs) for both project 1 and project 2 of this investment program revealed weak review, supervision, and monitoring of procurement processes (footnote 10)."

Therefore, it is important that DRBFC is more involved in ongoing and new projects and works closely with the development partners. In addition, PMU should work with DRBFC in decision-making regarding civil works’ contract implementation, completion, oversight during the defects liability period, demobilization of the contractor, and taking over the roads. This is critical for the sustainability of works financed by both the government and development partners."
0,"In line with previous analysis, two scenarios are considered: without and with-project for the LBDCIS and Barrage. At appraisal, without project approach considered LBDCIS supplying no additional water, hence no increase in agriculture production attributable to the river source and with infrastructure and water resource degradation, cropping intensity and yields were assumed to decline. At completion, cropping intensity was found to increase over time and yield varied by crop. This trend and rate of change informed with-project scenario at completion for benefits calculations associated with river water availability, resulting in increases agriculture production and decreases pumping cost."

Converting total project costs to economic costs, the actual economic costs were 10.9% lower than what likely would have been calculated at appraisal. Major project activities were delayed, starting in earnest in 2013 despite effectiveness in 2011. The physical completion date for the project loan and grant was subsequently extended by 1 year to 31 December 2016 to compensate for this delay. By project completion, 14 of the 16 project output indicator targets were achieved (eight targets exceeded) and one was partially achieved. Three of the four targets for outcome indicators were exceeded, with the fourth partially achieved.

A common experience shared by some of the public vocational colleges was that after receiving their equipment and training from the project, they experienced a sudden surge in demand from industry. The demand was for collaborative arrangements such as commissioned work, short-term training for enterprises, internships, and scholarship offers in exchange for a commitment to work in the enterprises for a fixed time. The enterprises have been more willing to participate in training activities and provide input to the colleges’ curricula. According to some vocational colleges, because of the project, the skills gap between their new graduates and the current workers has narrowed, and enterprises are willing to pay vocational colleges in return for providing students for internships.33"

0,"While the project design was relevant in focusing on the key underlying causes of the poor water supply in Dili, it was overambitious in terms of the required scope and necessary integration of activities, and timelines to achieve the planned outputs and outcomes in a fragile and recently conflict-affected country (paras. 7, 8, and 9). For this reason, the project is rated less than relevant. Given the state of the water system prior to the project, the limited capacity  of the relevant institutions, and consumers who treated water as a free commodity, the project had to address core institutional capacity, community awareness, and behavioral change, combined with infrastructure investment and development of sustainable systems. As such, the range of interventions in the design should have been more focused and integrated, with a more limited scope (in terms of coverage given the level of funds). Investment at a zonal level rather than at the sub-zone level, and a stronger emphasis on the supporting utility capacity and institutional reform, and the streamlining of payment and collection systems would have had a greater potential as a pilot project to demonstrate best practice that could have been replicated subject to additional funding."

In principle, there are opportunities to provide additional assistance, but this may be difficult in practice. The government is encouraging SOEs to source their own funding without government support, but many SOEs do not have the financial strength to borrow on a non- sovereign basis. Opportunities to blend sovereign and non-sovereign lending to SOEs are limited by the 2017 Law on Public Debt Management and the 2018 Decree 97 on On-Lending of the Government’s ODA Loans and Foreign Concessional Loans. This is nonetheless an important area because SOEs comprise a large portion of the Viet Nam’s economy, and ADB will need to continue to explore opportunities for both non-sovereign and blended lending to SOEs."

0,"As noted at appraisal, the principal economic benefits of the investment are incremental consumption and displaced thermal electricity generation. These benefits arise from a reduction in technical and non-technical losses attributable to component 1 (expansion of the high voltage distribution system (HVDS) scheme and other distribution system strengthening and upgrading) and component 2 (installation of capacitor banks in the distribution system, construction of new 33/11 kilovolt (kV) substations and 11kV feeders and the distribution line augmentation and upgrading subproject). Component 1 was scaled back from the investment planned at appraisal (parts of the HVDS scheme were completed under other projects of the MFF) and the extent of loss reduction was scaled proportionately in the reevaluation. Under component 2, it was expected at appraisal that most of the reactive compensation would be provided mainly at the low voltage (0.4kV) level through the installation of 30,000 low voltage capacitor banks. However, during detailed planning and design this was reconsidered in light of the extensive adoption of the HVDS scheme and ultimately all reactive compensation was provided by way of medium voltage (11kV) capacitor banks. For the purposes of this analysis and in lieu of better information, it was assumed that the loss reduction benefit arising from component 2 was as estimated at appraisal (which itself was based on sample load flow studies undertaken by DISCOM-C)."

The EIA concluded that the project area did not include any sensitive areas such as national parks, protected areas, or special use forests within or near the project alignment. Endangered, threatened, or rare species of flora and fauna were not found in the project area. Predicted environmental impacts during construction included air pollution, mainly due to dust emission, noise and vibration, water pollution due to fuel spills and improper waste disposal, soil erosion and siltation of water courses due to earthworks and extraction of borrow materials, and temporary obstructions of river flow. Impacts during operation were expected to be limited to air and noise pollution due to vehicular emissions, and potential water pollution due to accidents involving transportation of chemicals and other hazardous materials. Land use within the project area was dominated by tree plantations (mainly rubber) and paddy fields. Accordingly, the VEC prepared an environment management plan (EMP)."

The intended project outcome of higher mobility of people and goods was attributable to the project intervention, and the project outputs were substantially achieved. Before the project, the road was in poor condition and became a bottleneck for international and domestic traffic. It was almost unpaved, with an IRI of about 12–14, often water logged, and mostly unusable during winter. Upon completion, the entire section of 60 km was rehabilitated with full asphalt surfacing, new and reconstructed bridges, improved drainage system, and adequate road safety facilities. The IRI of the completed project road was 2, better than the IRI of at least 4 anticipated at appraisal. The improvements completely changed the transport condition and facilitated local and international traffic. The project has led to more efficient movement of freight and passenger traffic along the road at a time of increasing demand, in particular because of growing trade with the PRC and tourism development. Average travel time between Naryn and Torugart has been reduced to about 2.5 hours, vs. the DMF indicator of 4 hours.

1,"Response to changes in the political landscape. Changes brought about by national elections had a significant impact on program implementation. The unforeseen split of the MIME into two line-ministries after the national elections and the subsequent transfer of the SPS-2 subproject to the MIH affected disbursement progress and led to the failure to submit audited financial statements. Likewise, the significant level of support that was provided by ADB to commercialize the ILCC was negated by the government’s change in priorities. ADB should more pro-actively intervene in these situations to ensure proposed reforms remain on track and that new executing or implementing agencies are fully aware of their program related responsibilities."

0,"The reevaluation illustrates that both roads are economically viable, with the EIRR for the Mendi–Kandep road estimated at 17.8%, and the EIRR for the Laiagam–Porgera road estimated at 17.7%. This compares with the extant EIRR estimate of 16.5% for each road section. The Mendi–Kandep road is assessed as more sensitive to changes in key assumptions than the Laiagam–Porgera road. The viability of the Laiagam–Porgera road is comparatively insensitive to increases in capital cost and reductions in traffic. Notably, the viability of both roads is comparatively insensitive to assumptions of a combined reduction in maintenance and traffic. Cost overruns of 8% and 16% are not considered significant. The 10-month delay in completing construction beyond the 30-month construction schedule also does not appear to have affected outcomes. The report and recommendation of the president also noted that the proposed road works were economically justifiable even with a 20% increase in construction costs and a 20% reduction in traffic. Details of the economic reevaluation are in Appendix 10."
0,"To help poor farmers recover as quickly as possible from the crisis and underpin agriculture extension efforts, the project design included subsidies for improved seeds and fertilizers. The subsidies continued into the additional financing phase, despite having been described as a one-off measure in the project document. Their longer-term use was justified by their clear pro-poor targeting, potential catalytic effect for risk-averse smallholders, and conformity with existing GAFSP practices regarding innovative cost-sharing initiatives."
0,"The project (including additional financing) exceeded almost all performance targets. Counterpart funds were made available on time. The CPMU established a thorough project performance monitoring system, developed practices for collecting gender-disaggregated data, applied comprehensive beneficiary targeting procedures, and developed appropriate and innovative legal arrangements for engaging with farmers’ associations for seed production and with households for CFW contracting. It completed all staff training and project management capacity development, and successfully introduced new institutional coordination arrangements to implement the CFRS. As EA, MEF had a relatively strong capacity to coordinate and implement multisector interventions, partly because of the commitment and continuity of its senior staff. The performance of the borrower and executing agency was highly satisfactory."

0,"The project was classified category B for environment at appraisal. The government prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) for each subproject. The project was not expected to cause significant environmental problems and the likely adverse impacts were manageable. In line with national requirements, the project was classified low risk environmental impact. The environmental management plans (EMPs), with mitigation measures proposed in the IEE, were included in all civil works contracts. The PCU coordinated the implementation of EMPs 26 Contracts with a total value of less than $100,000. and environmental mitigation activities including obtaining permissions as needed in compliance with government regulations. The PMCs supervised environmental protection activities at all construction sites. The contractor prepared a site-specific EMP with a safety, health, and environment control plan, which was endorsed by the engineer and approved by the PCU. The PPMU and PMCs conducted a series of environmental training programs covering management, site audits, identification and solving of issues, and preparation of environmental monitoring reports for contractors and engineers. Overall, the PPMU prepared six environmental monitoring reports, which were disclosed on ADB’s website in 20142017. The final environmental monitoring report covered post-construction environmental audit, and the PCU confirmed that majority of the environmental measures were implemented to the required standard (Appendix 10). The project was classified category C for indigenous people safeguards. No ethnic minority or indigenous people lived in the project area or were affected by the project."

The north–south railway line reduces the distance for transportation of goods from Central Asia to the ports on the Persian Gulf by about 680 km. The line is expected to become an important link in the transcontinental transport corridor between Asia and Europe. The railway has been envisioned to improve the efficiency of train operations through a reduction in travel distance and time, as well as a decrease in operating costs."
1,"In comparison with previous urban loans, the project increased coverage to more cities.  The uneven capacities in three areas were reflected through the funds allocated to the areas and  the capacity building program designed under the project. Dagana was an area that ADB had not  previously supported and it is also where there were some quality issues in the infrastructure built.  Capacity could not be built as envisioned because of changes in government policy related to the  funding of training. This could have been better bridged by increased consulting services;  however, toward the end of the project, there was also increased focus on optimizing consulting  services in donor-funded projects, which made it difficult to increase allocations to Dagana. While  the slope stability study for Dagana was delayed because of the challenges of working in a difficult  terrain, the delay could have been better managed by stronger supervision (para. 26). 34 For example, there is a need to further strengthen capacity in accounting and financial management, preparing bid"

In addition to the civil works contracts, two consulting services contracts were planned, finalized, and awarded: one for project support and one for construction and maintenance supervision. Signed civil works and consulting services contracts were conducted as planned. Procurement of the civil works packages was carried out in accordance with ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).

There may be various reasons behind this, but an important one is that social monitoring reports were not explicitly stated as a regular deliverable in the CSC’s terms of reference. Hence, the lists of deliverables should be discussed with and understood by the executing agency and the selected CSC during contract negotiations, both regarding  contents and timing, and be indicated clearly in the contract.     The payment could have been linked to the deliverables. Moreover, the lists of deliverables should be consistent with the project administration manual and the loan agreement, if applicable, which also helps remind ADB of its responsibility of close guidance and follow-up until the project closes."

1,"Design and specification changes. During implementation, some designs and  specifications were revised to better adjust to site conditions and improve the quality of  construction material. Some of the engineering design standards (e.g., Asian Highway standards)  and the design-and-build approach used in the main civil works contract were new to the  executing agency, which led to some misunderstandings. This required resolution by  management staff from the contractor, PMWSC, and PIURR, which took a lot of time and delayed  the addressing of project requirements. If this approach is to be used, care is needed in project  and bidding document preparation so (i) the contractor can program its design and works in  accordance with its method statement, and (ii) the executing agency can ensure approval of the  engineering design in accordance with prevailing government procedures. Regarding (ii), a  clearer framework is needed to ensure that design or specification changes are reviewed by  relevant authorities and approved in a timely fashion. This will avoid causing contractual delays  while enhancing the transparency and robustness of audit processes."

As the MFF, including project 3, was not designed for capital cost recovery, the operating ratios (revenue–O&M cost ratios) calculated for the 10 ULBs averaged 1.0:0.9, indicating that the ULBs have the financial capacity to meet operating expenses out of internal revenues and assigned compensations (para. 40).31 The Constitution of India (Article 243X) mandates the state to allocate to the ULBs associated sources of finance and functionaries required to manage the assigned functions and sustain service delivery. ULBs’ finances are structured through fiscal transfers from the state in the form of compensation grants (in lieu of octroi tax on goods [since abolished] and other taxes subsumed under the Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017), transfers from the CFC and SFC, tariff enhancement, and performance improvement in collection of taxes and user charges. CFC transfers account for about 30%–40% of ULB finances, of which up to 90% may be used for O&M of municipal assets. However, less than the required levels of ownership of STPs by project ULBs has led to delayed O&M payments to contractors, resulting in suboptimal maintenance of the STPs. The IPMU has agreed to resolve this situation by 30 September 2019 (para. 56). A review of the overall finances of the PHED and Public Works Department indicates the ability of the two departments to meet the O&M requirements of the existing assets, and inclusion of new projects, through state budgetary allocations.32 Further, analysis indicates consistency in timely release of requisite O&M funds by the state, as providing water is a fundamental duty of the state."

Table A14.2 presents the cash flows of the FIRR recalculations. Additionally, the FIRR was subject to sensitivity tests. Combining a 20% increase in O&M costs and a 20% decrease in revenue, the FIRR was at 3.8% before tax and 3.2% after tax. The test results indicated that the FIRR was very sensitive to the revenue changes (Table A14.1).

The project objectives were to enhance regional coordination and cooperation in Communicable Diseases Control (CDC) and improve disease control systems along border areas. The rationale for the project was that emerging and neglected diseases pose a major public concern in the region. The project aimed to build on the achievements of the first project which focused on strengthening surveillance and outbreak response capacity.

The outcomes of project 1 contributed to the targeted impacts, but it was not possible to estimate the overall impact at the time of project completion. While the project contributed to sustainable social and economic growth, the government must continue to improve funding for sustainable and dedicated road maintenance over the longer term. The project’s contribution to improved governance and capacity development has also been mixed. Environmental control and safeguard measures for project 1 were only partially implemented and partially effective."
0,"The project 3 is rated effective as four of the five outcomes and 31 out of 35 outputs have been achieved (Appendix 1, for project 3). Drinking water quality in two ULBs meets national water quality standards as a result of water supply interventions taken up under project 3. Reliability and average duration of supply has increased, though 8 hours of daily supply could not be achieved, especially in summers in the desert region, and 0.27 million people (95% of the population of the project towns) are being provided with more than 127 lpcd of water. Nonrevenue water has reportedly been reduced to 20% and 15% in the two ULBs as targeted. Project interventions developed piped sewerage infrastructure, including STPs, benefitting 100% of the population in five ULBs. All ULBs have reported covering more than 90% of households with door- to-door collection and transportation of municipal solid waste, including proportionate coverage of slum and low-income households and women-headed households."

But, during implementation, in Bangladesh and Nepal, the service level agreements between RTCs and service agencies to ensure the supply of internet and adequate bandwidth connecting the CECs and RTCs to the regional and village networks were not signed. This was because of the absence of a commercial review from RTN and delays in the transfer of the related project infrastructure from the executing agencies to the service agencies.38 As a result, the CEC and RTC operations did not have financial support for sustainability."

The external monitoring consultants confirmed the affected households’ participation in the community meetings and consultations organized by the CARCs at the affected communes and wards. The meetings covered the following key topics: (i) project’s objectives and schedule; (ii) rights and entitlements of the affected households to compensation and resettlement; (iii) necessary assistances for severely affected households, relocating households, and vulnerable households; (iv) income and livelihood restoration measures targeting the affected people; and (v) the grievance redress mechanism."

The status of compliance with the loan covenants is in Appendix 9. Compliance with covenants 39, 40, and 44 on performing all obligations set forth in Schedule 6 of the Loan Agreement and sound administrative policies and procedures of the borrower’s departments and agencies was affected by the discontinuation of executing agency. Covenants 47 on operation and maintenance of the project facilities was only partially complied with due to non-utilization of the trade books produced under the project since 2013 and usability of only 12% of the learning centers, most of which were temporary structure by design, as of 2017. Delayed compliance of five covenants (covenants 14, 18, 30, 33, and 34) related to execution of the project activities was due to the loan suspension. Despite the delayed compliance, these covenants helped facilitate the project implementation."

A total of Nu37,371,106.56 were paid to the affected households for the loss of land, structures and trees and 108.99 acres were provided in replacement land. Affected persons were given the options of land replacement or cash compensations for the loss of land, or a combination of both. Many of the households (170 households) opted for land replacement in the same dungkhag (subdistrict). Compensation payments and land replacement allotments were carried out by the project and district administration officials and grievance redressal committees at the local level were constituted.

As such it did not appear commensurate with the capacity of SIDBI having robust systems to manage MSME subloans that are backed by sound national level banking regulations. In pursuing higher and meaningful MSME subsector impacts, any future MSME subsector investments to a national-level agency such as SIDBI may pursue larger project size that is consistent with its implementation capacities, and/or sharper focus such as on the specific geographical areas."

INRM following ADB mission in February 2012 found that 9 out of 13 civil works contracts had achieved less than 1% progress during July–December 2011. These initial delays were mainly caused by (i) extended rainfall that affected the availability of adequate work sites; and (ii) the failure of some contractors to make effective use of that period for mobilization activities. However, following close monitoring and meetings with MPRDC, the performance of the contractors started to improve during January–February 2012. ADB missions and MPRDC also actively engaged in resolving the implementation delays and took measures to expedite progress, including the preparation of action plans. MPRDC took stringent actions against slow progressing contractors and terminated two civil works contracts for very poor performance in October 2012 and July 2013. To complete the remaining works, new contracts were procured, and the contracts were awarded in May and November 2013. The ADB mission in October 2013 observed that four civil works contract packages, which had maintained good progress since commencement, had been completed. Some of the other contract packages were lagging behind the original schedule, mainly due to deficiencies in planning and in the timely availability of resources, besides the heavy extended rainfall in 2013."

Instead, there were some consultant specialists whose terms of reference required them to deal with gender issues in their field of responsibility but had limited gender expertise. It was a challenge to ensure the high quality implementation of the GAP, especially in achieving targets. The project executing agency and implementing agency did not routinely monitor and report to ADB on the progress of the GAP during project implementation, which resulted in information and data gaps in the reporting of GAP results.

However, several drainage structures were damaged due to flows exceeding their designed capacity, particularly during monsoon season. Admittedly, climate change factors were not incorporated in the design. This highlights the importance of the climate resilience guidelines drafted by the DOR which is intended to be mainstreamed into all road designs. According to the department, lessons learned from this project greatly contributed to the drafting of this instrument."

0,"Evidence of project outcomes on women. The project’s overall goal of increased literacy skills, social awareness, and income-generation capacity of disadvantaged people translated into positive benefits for women and had the ripple effect of improving women’s lives and participation in decision-making at the household, community, and local government levels. For example, a woman graduate became an earning member of the family and could allocate resources to address critical needs of children and other female family members. Women graduates became more active in local governance structures and systems and could advocate for better service delivery and an improved community environment. As one woman from Kurigram, Rajshahi mentioned during the focus group discussion, “…even before the training on making nakshi kathas (traditional blankets), I was stitching and selling the nakshi kathas, as is tradition. But with the training, I have learnt the tricks of refining my stitching style, and I can make many intricate designs that are more attractive. With the training, I can do more nakshi kathas in a week and the quality is better and it sells at better prices in the markets. This has helped me to earn more money and spend more on my children. I am now thinking of marketing my goods in the big bazaar in the district.” Beyond the home, women graduates now actively involve themselves in community matters. Women graduates in Patuakhali, Barisal now actively participate in ward-level meetings to discuss specific issues related to them and to place their demands to the pourashava (municipal town) chairman and mayor. The women graduates from the area have been actively engaging with the female ward commissioners at the pourashava level to repair the main road through the village that leads to the primary school in the area. They hope to have regular budget allocation to take up the necessary construction work. When asked about improved health and hygiene, women at the focus group discussion in Bagerhat, Khulna stated that they now have greater access to health care services simply because they now know where to go and what to ask for at the subdistrict health complex. Women now actively seek out community health workers to ensure their children and newborns receive all the government vaccines. Before, even when community health workers came door-to-door requesting they vaccinate their children, the local women turned these health workers away because of superstition and fear of the unknown. Now women feel and act more empowered because of their direct and indirect participation in the project.

To ensure a program’s successful implementation, adequate attention must be given to implementability of the policy conditions. Under the PSERP, that limitation was overcome by focusing on specific actions rather than institutional capacities. The PSERP required actions such as corporatization and improving corporate governance compliance, for instance, and in order to achieve these objectives the program also ensured that needed changes were made in relevant statutes covering corporate governance rules and laws."

1,"The design of the project, which encompassed activities that involved the community and sought their input, provided an opportunity for the value of education to be discussed especially in rural and remote communities. The design included publications on girls’ education and on vocational training. The project’s success in increasing the participation rates of females provides considerable evidence of how future projects might effectively address the issue of increased female participation in USE. Some of the critical factors associated with the project’s success were the following: (i) the need for a clear understanding of the importance of improving gender equity by all involved; (ii) training of education managers at all levels and teachers in the importance of values and attitudes that encourage female and ethnic minority participation and success; (iii) extensive training for principals so that they ensured that equity was addressed within their schools; and (iv) training of students, who were thus able to understand better the importance of education as an opportunity provider for all and as the major means of overcoming disadvantage."

0,"Overall performance of the government (borrower) and the executing agency is rated satisfactory. Both demonstrated commitment to the success of the project despite time overruns, and changes to the implementation arrangement and design. Government project document was revised and approved to incorporate changes, warranting provincial and federal government approvals. The executing agency made efforts to ensure that the counterpart funds provided were sufficient and timely. Continuity of financing and implementation arrangements after loan closure demonstrates the government’s resolve to complete the works. Reforms in the canal command area, which were ambitious, did not fully follow the design at appraisal despite assurances from the government. The government missed an opportunity to maximize support to farmer organizations through ADB financing. The executing agency implemented the financial management system and maintained separate and audited accounts. The executing agency implemented the project following ADB’s guidelines on financial management, safeguards, disbursements, procurement of works, recruitment of consultants, and management of contracts. ADB was consulted for guidance on critical matters and prior approvals were obtained where needed. The government closed loan accounts. Employer-induced delays in construction were concurrent and included poor coordination with the PID field units, changes in the type or number of structures in response to demands from the public and farmer organizations, and land acquisition delays on the Balloki Barrage. The PID did not move well with staffing issues, specifically in filling vacant posts during the last 3 years."

The pilot EPC contract for Co Ngua pumping station faced difficulties during procurement and execution because (i) MARD was not familiar with ADB’s plant standard bidding document; (ii) joint ventures for EPC arrangements were uncommon in Viet Nam; and (iii) ADB and counterpart agencies’ interpreted work allocation and contractual obligations among the joint venture partners differently. Thus, it took a long time to prepare bidding documents, evaluate bids, and execute and liquidate the contract."

The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated based on actual investment costs, actual and projected operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses. To calculate the EIRR, benefit and cost streams were discounted in the economic analysis, taking into account the economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC) of 12% at the time of project preparation. A subproject is declared economically beneficial when the EIRR is greater than the EOCC.

A subproject is considered sustainable when the FIRR exceed the WACC."
1,"Project readiness. The project lacked readiness since the multilateral, bilateral, and in- country agreements setting up the overall implementation framework were signed 3 years into the project’s implementation. Also, no procurement activities commenced upon approval. In a highly time-sensitive sector such as ICT, high project readiness could help prevent start-up delays and enforce the commitment of the executing agencies. The issue of limited project readiness was compounded by the fact that all the executing agencies were implementing an ADB project for the first time and thus were challenged in smoothly complying with all the requirements associated with receiving ADB assistance."

1,"The project encountered major implementation issues because of lengthy government approval of project feasibility studies and long delays in consultant engagement, contract registration, and procurement of civil works contracts. The project yields the following important lessons:"
1,"Because of the delay of engagement of the environmental monitoring agency at start-up phase, surface water and groundwater quality, fisheries, and air pollution were not monitored until 2012. The post monitoring environmental reports initially did not include all the measurements stipulated in the EIA. ADB observed lack of capacity of the operation staff and guided the relevant staff on proper environmental monitoring and its reporting."
1,"The project modality and scope should be carefully considered during project preparation.  The simple stand-alone project loan modality is less advantageous when implementing a multi- component project that involves a wide range of subsectors and project proponents, unless the  executing agency has strong project management capacity. Given a sound development policy  and firm medium-term investment plan, a more flexible project modality—such as financial  intermediation and results-based lending—should be considered. Alternatively, the project scope  should be well focused to minimize the complexity of project management."
0,"The project trained (i) 967 staff of implementing NGOs and MOPA on curriculum materials (62% of target); (ii) 832 implementing NGO staff (198% of target) and 14,362 facilitators (99% of target) on course implementation; (iii) 135 MOPA staff on program monitoring and evaluation (78% of target); and (iv) 98 BNFE staff on staff development (136% of target). Accreditation system for NGOs was developed in 2011, and a web-based MIS in 2012. An institutional strengthening and sustainability plan was prepared and distributed in 2011, including PPP, decentralized planning management, and the shifting of BNFE and MOPME roles from direct implementation to management of implementation. Beginning May 2010, all documents and information developed under the project, including a list of continuing education centers (CECs) with pictures and learners’ lists, were regularly uploaded on the website. By 2017, the MIS was not in use due to the demobilization of PIMU and turnover of BNFE staff."
0,"The investment program was relevant given the strong government priority to have a productive and clean river water management in one of the strategic river in the country. The modality was appropriate as it provided a long term commitment for financing the IWRM roadmap. However, the MFF approach was hampered by the lack of project readiness for the subsequent tranches. This resulted in cancellation of the subsequent tranches. The PFR1 is rated relevant. They directly supported national development priorities. They were in line with ADB’s country strategy, and supported the government development objectives and operationalization of the water law and the IWRM agenda. The IWRM road map also supported the national planning for IWRM. The minor changes made during implementation enhanced the likelihood of achieving project outputs, outcomes, and impacts."
1,"Overall, the project was less than successful. 23  The project was implemented with  substantial delays and major changes in the financing plan, within project cost but with 69.3% of  ADB loan proceeds canceled. It was completed with a delay of over 4 years and required the  use of additional government resources. The total project cost was reduced because ADB and  the government did not extend the loan. The government has continuous ownership and  leadership of the Treasury's modernization, but has reduced its commitment to the PFM reform  timeline."

1,"In designing a successful program, it is essential to understand (i) the level of the government’s support for policy-level reforms, (ii) institutional constraints, and (iii) the technical capacity of government agencies and other relevant stakeholders to handle comprehensive reforms. ADB’s involvement in the program strengthened the executing agency’s commitment to and stakeholder support for complex and time-consuming reforms."
0,"Overall, the project is rated less than effective. Of the six targeted outcomes, three were not fully measured (annual increase in traffic, reduction in overloaded vehicles, and reduction of accidents). The remaining outcomes were achieved (road maintenance, reduced travel time, and increase in public motor vehicle services). The change in scope and reduction of outputs occurred not because of a failure in the original design, but rather because of the government’s decision regarding the LNG project. The DMF should have been revised during implementation to address the reduced scope. This was an oversight on the part of ADB. The DMF (Appendix 1) has a detailed assessment."
1,The program’s success was due to its ability to address the entire range of obstacles for women entrepreneurship (demand and supply-side related) through combination of the PBL and FIL.
1,"Domestic procedures. Government projects are guided by standardized management procedures, and those procedures are applicable to international projects as well. However, for the GEF component, a parallel domestic process for the GEF component was not initiated during the project preparatory TA, nor was any budget provision made for it during project implementation. Therefore, a number of GEF activities that needed to comply with domestic procedures were only implemented as parts of bigger government projects where the domestic procedures were complete."
1,"The government did not draw down the proceeds of the loan until after the award of a substantial number of contracts for rehabilitation of schools, although it had earlier withdrawn the DPL to meet financing requirements for the HFH scheme. The lack of a definite schedule for disbursement required ADB to maintain close coordination with the government. This ensured timely disbursement when required."

It should implement institutional reforms to strengthen its capacity to manage, procure, and monitor road maintenance contracts. Development partners must remain committed to supporting road maintenance to ensure the sustainability of road service improvements. For future ADB and development partners budget support operations, consideration should be given to the inclusion of reform actions that ensure adequate budgetary allocations for the maintenance of major government owned assets, including the road."

Minor design issues were mitigated by IMC actions such as providing air- conditioning for sensitive electrical equipment and installing nets to prevent detritus and garbage from entering the pumping stations, to avoid pump damage. There also appeared to be good liaison between IMC staff, WUGs, and other intended beneficiaries.

Dengue control interventions (e.g., rapid testing) and clinical case management training were implemented in the CLV project provinces that had a high burden of the disease. In Viet Nam, the project supported additional preventive care, such as tetanus vaccination for women of reproductive age (WRAs), and vaccination against Japanese encephalitis and diphtheria for ethnic minority groups in remote and border areas."

0,"The planned length of roads to be improved under project 1 was reduced at the request of the government (footnote 5). The original project scope proposed five road sections totaling 211 km for improvements. Three of the road sections (Nipa–Magarima, Magarima–Ambua and Hiwinda Junction–Koroba) are part of the Highlands Highway (footnote 5). To compensate for the reduced scope of project 1, the government proposed adding five roads under the HCRN with a total road length of 108 km. These five roads were originally prepared under the earlier ADB- funded Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project.12 However, the cost estimates for these subproject roads, Mendi–Kandep and Laiagam–Porgera, prepared after the detailed engineering design was completed, exceeded the budget for road improvements under project 1.

0,"The project is considered relevant because of its high priority focus on improving management of the country’s water resources and related increase in rice production, which is in conformity with the government strategy, ADB’s country strategy and ADB’s sector operational plans for water resources and agriculture. It is considered effective due to substantial achievement of the outcome and all outputs. It is considered less than efficient despite the acceptable EIRR for the BHH component, due to lower than expected use of the WRU new campus at project completion. Finally, it is considered likely sustainable in view of (i) strong demand for quality drainage and irrigation in Viet Nam, (iii) good quality of civil works constructed and equipment provided, and (ii) suitable O&M arrangements are in place, along with new legislation firming up O&M funding.

Prior to the first extension, the government evaluated the consultant’s performance as satisfactory. The initial scope of the design and supervision services was increased, and the contract amount rose from $0.862 million to a final contract of $1.968 million. The extensions were approved under contract variations 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. While the terms and conditions remained the same in the first extension, the second extension covered the design and supervision of the rehabilitation works in zones 1 and 10 on the same terms as for the sub-zones 1, 2, and 3. The third extension covered the implementation of the construction works involvement in the international competitive bidding (ICB) tender process. The fourth extension was to supervise the completion of the contract for zones 1 and 10, and the fifth extension was to finalize the last payments to the contractor."
1,"Prioritizing occupational health and safety. During the early stages of construction, it appears that inadequate attention was being paid to occupational health and safety by NTPC and the HCC. The LTA’s reports during this period did highlight this aspect and called for improvements, which were subsequently put in place. With effective occupational health and safety systems, accidents and safety incidents can be minimized even on complex construction sites."
0,"Project delays caused the effective start date of the project to be delayed from 2011 to 2013 (only 2% of total costs had been incurred by the end of 2012); likewise, effective project completion was delayed until 2016 versus 2015 as outlined at appraisal estimate. The original plan was designed with 75% of costs occurring in the first two years of the project. For a project with significant investments in both civil works and equipment, this was an optimistic assumption. The project’s actual cost curve followed a bell pattern with most costs clustered around the middle of the project period. Despite this, the project, once physically begun, was completed in the same amount of time as contemplated in the appraisal. This is another indicator of project efficiency when coupled with lower total costs and project outcome achievement (discussed next in this analysis)."

Unless the borrower has the intent and capacity for rapid change, gradual reforms may be preferable and more sustainable (para. 31)."
0,"Completion of the project means that the entire international road corridor has been fully improved. This has positively impacted traffic flows on the adjacent sections, led to a substantial improvement in the performance of the entire corridor, and efficiently facilitated international traffic. Traffic levels remain low as a result of foreign trade and trade facilitation issues. 2016 was the first full year of the Kyrgyz Republic’s membership in the Eurasian Economic Union; this initially reduced trade with the PRC,16 but trade increased in 2017. The completion of transport corridor improvements is expected to promote and boost traffic during 2018–2020. The economic and social linkages between the PRC and Kyrgyz Republic and other EEU members are increasing, and cross-border traffic is expected to increase at an accelerated rate in the near future. Enhancements in trade facilitation play an important role in cross-border transportation, and may lead to a significant increase in traffic volume. Trade among CAREC countries is facilitated with the assistance of development partners. Logistics services along the project road corridor have been developed and there is a high potential for expansion, while the number of international tourists along the road is also expected to increase. The project also has non- quantifiable socioeconomic benefits. The details of the economic reevaluation are in Appendix 12."
1,"Following the lessons learned from the completed 220 kV GIS, the project applied a  different approach and arrangement as remedial action for civil works acceleration. Based on their  nature, the construction works were divided into five different lots to employ more local  subcontractors47 (against only one involved in the 220 kV GIS project) to enable them to have  access to larger man power and civil material resources, and to work simultaneously thus  reducing further delays and poor performance in the completion of civil works."

0,"Women in the project area are largely involved in household work, cultivation, and other agricultural activities, including some employment in government and the private sector. Their use of roads ranges from day-to-day household activities to economic activities, such as agriculture and markets. At appraisal, the gender classification of the project was “some gender benefits.” During appraisal, consultation and assessment of gender issues was carried out. The focus group discussions concluded that road safety during construction should be ensured. Most women felt that the improved roads would benefit them as they would be get better access to markets for selling their products, thereby helping to increase household income. Provisions were made in the bidding documents for the contractors to ensure that all civil works would comply with all applicable labor laws. Specifically, child labor would not be used for construction and maintenance activities; employment of the poor particularly women would be encouraged; and no wage difference would be made between men and women for work of equal value. At appraisal, a study of the impact of past ADB-funded state road projects on women was carried out, which focused on gender, land acquisition and resettlement, health, and labor.17 The findings of the study showed that past ADB-funded road projects have provided women with better economic opportunities and improved access to healthcare and education."

1,"Specific lessons from unevenly implemented reforms and ADB experience working with farmers organizations were not fully internalized. The design for the modernization of operations and institutional strengthening was assertive. The design, however, proved to be more challenging at implementation and several issues had to be addressed. First, the project design had to be adapted to the institutional structure and legal framework prevalent across other devolved canal command areas. This change brought clarity to PIDA, PID, area water boards, and farmers organizations, and enabled PIDA to use the experience gained from older area water boards and farmer organizations. An example was the adoption of training materials in the LBDC command area prepared by PIDA and JICA in an earlier project.31 Second, in 2008, ADB joined the working group for streamlining institutional reforms in irrigation management and maintained a continuous dialogue with the government and key development partners. The recommendations from the working group facilitated PIDA revising area water boards and farmers organizations’ rules and regulations. Third, ADB maintained a strong follow up when reforms were on hold in 2008–2009."

The FIRR was minus 18% and the FNPV was minus $2.230 million. The FIRR at project completion indicates the sub-zone projects were not financially viable, as the FIRR was below the WACC, which was estimated at 2.20 (Appendix 9). The lower FIRR reflects the significantly lower water revenue (from poor service, fewer customers than planned, and low billing collection rate) and the absence of any saving in electricity and chemical costs from a reduction in NRW, as the  planned decrease in NRW losses did not eventuate."

1,"The project is rated efficient because the intended outputs and outcome were achieved within the loan and grant budget, and on time. At completion, the discounted total benefits of the project over 6 years in three countries are estimated at about $95.9 million (in 2010 $). With a total cost of $74 million over 5 years, the project’s economic net present value is estimated at about $21.8 million (high for Viet Nam, and negative for both Cambodia and the Lao PDR), lower than appraised ($27 million), while the economic internal rate of return is estimated at 21%, against 28% at appraisal.19 This is a conservative estimate of the total economic benefits from the project because it excludes possible sustained benefits years after the end of the project and only considers the direct benefits from fewer disease outbreaks and more productivity benefits. Other potential benefits include a reduction in the cost of health services, improvements in learning and cognitive performance, better maternal outcomes as a result of deworming, and the impact on the population of interrupted disease transmission. An estimation of these benefits would require more substantive data collection and modeling. An updated economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 11."

0,"The overall road construction costs for project 1 exceeded the appraisal estimates despite the reduction in scope. The reasons for the cost increases were: (i) the unit construction cost estimated during preparation was based on road-improvement contracts ongoing at that time under supplementary financing for the Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project, which focused on rehabilitation; however, during the detailed engineering designof the project 1 roads, it was determined that these unpaved roads needed not only sealing, but also major improvements in road geometry and drainage; (ii) the LNG project raised unit costs in the construction industry nationwide; (iii) the replacement, upgrading, and/or reconstruction of seven bridges for the Mendi–Kandep road and nine bridges for the Laiagam–Porgera road were unplanned; (iv) payment to the PNG defense and police forces to maintain law and order at the construction sites was unforeseen; and (v) increased land compensation claims.

1,"A major lesson from the program is the need for sustained engagement in view of the long- term commitment required to implement social welfare reforms. While ADB has been successful in introducing poverty-targeted mechanisms to distribute welfare benefits and establishing the Food Stamp Program, less progress has been achieved by the government in consolidating welfare programs. This takes time, because of the need to identify and compensate those affected by the consolidation process, and it requires continued support through long-term engagement. Furthermore, setbacks can be expected during or after implementation. The pre-election expenditure in 2016 in the aftermath of this program is a good example. Despite this setback, many of the policy actions that had been introduced through the program remained intact. ADB’s decision to reengage after the election was pragmatic, as it abled ADB to not only respond to the worsening economic situation, but also to build on the hard-won reforms introduced earlier."

If the requirements were specified and  detailed on the drawings, a simple linear meter rate incorporating all those items would have been  included. Once the work had been inspected and found compliant, measurement would have  been simpler and more accurate.

0,"Another significant change to the project design vis-à-vis this output occurred about mid- way through implementation. Prior to the Mid-term review mission (December 2010) ADB 9 During 2000–2008, AusAID assisted in developing and implementing the Agriculture Quality Improvement Program (AQIP) which developed several seed production centers that were successful in developing high-yielding rice seeds suitable for Cambodia. Subsequently, the AQIP Seed Company was incorporated as a registered commercial entity. This entity was largely owned by the private sector, with some ownership maintained by research institutes. The company had developed a commercially viable business for the production and distribution of high-quality rice seeds. Regional production centers had been established which provided cleaned, tested, and packaged rice seeds to farmers, dealers, government, and nongovernment agencies. Under the project original design, procurement of the rice seeds was to be serviced almost entirely by the AQIP Seed Company following direct contracting procedures, along with provision for direct procurement of rice seeds from local seed producers’ associations. agreed in a minor change of scope10 to RGC’s request to support existing Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries research stations (i.e., Toul Samroang Rice Seed Farm and Kbal Koh Vegetable Research Station) in the supply of quality rice and vegetable seeds to smallholders. At the same time, MAFF (through the Directorate General of Agriculture) also intended to contract with Farmer Associations/Farmer Groups to supply seed to meet the original targets. This clearly had the desirable effect of more closely linking the domestic production of improved seeds (including by farmers who would thereby receive and income from sales) with their more widespread use by smallholders. The inclusion of a quality seed production activity within the output 2 scope allowed a new performance target of ‘1,350 tons of rice seed, and 46 tons of vegetable and other crop seeds are to be produced through Quality Seed Production’ to be introduced to the DMF, and also the numbers of farmers to eventually be targeted by seeds supply from research stations and Farmer Associations/farmer Groups and extension services  to rise by the end of the project period (to 70,000 households, from 50,000 originally)."

Similarly, cost estimation for a new technology being used for  the first time in a new setting is always challenging. The dilemma is that if the cost estimates are  too conservative, the plant costs may increase so much that the plant construction will be at risk.  The overall financial strength of the project sponsors for projects that may require a significant,  unanticipated amount of counterpart financing is important.

1,"Procurement and low bid prices. This has been observed as a growing phenomenon  across many ADB projects, as well as those funded by other donors, in the PRC. This  phenomenon is a result of many issues, including overestimating during bid preparation, price  analysis during bid evaluation, and low capacity of the implementing agency in contract  management. Most specifically, the cost estimate in the procurement plan is based on a feasibility  study report in the PRC, and the risk premium is always high in feasibility study report estimates.  More advance preparation will improve the accuracy of the cost estimates. While a recent  procurement reform in ADB should help address this situation,30 certain additional measures  should be considered to avoid further negative impacts on loan utilization. Such measures could  be related to more accurate bid preparations, including detailed designs and cost estimates, and  price analysis during bid evaluation. ADB and the PMO should make significant efforts to  strengthen the capacity of the implementing agency on procurement matters. Improvements in  the existing PRC's tracking system for sanctioned local bidders would also be essential for  addressing the problem. 30 The latest Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers refer to cases of abnormally low bids, where after careful examination, the borrower is given the option to reject the bid or request that the amount of the performance security  be increased at the expense of the bidder."

1,"Expanded surveillance and response systems. The project contributed to substantially improved national S&R systems11 through its support to outbreak investigation, rapid reporting and response, and laboratory services. Villages and districts routinely reported event-based outbreak information. Increased reporting of disease outbreaks had already been noted as the project progressed. Rapid response capacity improved thanks to functioning emergency response centers and response teams at all levels. The project provided equipment and vehicles to facilitate outbreak response, especially in remote villages. Health staff and volunteers received training on immediate investigation and response. Small funding was made available for initial investigation of and response to incidents so as to prevent more serious disease outbreaks. Joint outbreak investigation and response in border villages was also promoted. Essential laboratory equipment and consumables for stronger diagnostic capacity were procured and provided to targeted provincial and district laboratories. Laboratory staff received competency-based training aimed to improve the reliability and safety of diagnostic services. Though additional financing, the project helped update the vector surveillance and control guidelines as well as training manuals, procured vector control equipment, and trained staff on malaria diagnosis, use of diagnostic equipment, administration of anti-malarial drugs, and reporting malaria cases through the district health information systems."

Project 1 provided groundwater knowledge and a research base in the LBDC command area through the development of a groundwater database, field surveys, modeling, and assessment of the command area water balance and resources. The database contained over 300 GIS data layers and 88 maps of salinity and groundwater status. The project strengthened groundwater resource management capacities of key government staff, drillers, equipment suppliers, and farmers. Project 1 prepared policy options, development framework, and a strategy for improving water resources management, reversing groundwater deterioration, sustainable management of land and water resources, and sustainable use of the aquifer. Project 1 provided a groundwater management plan, which supported provincial initiatives in groundwater management in line with the Punjab Canal and Drainage Act amendment in 2006.

0,"In the target sub-zones, where investment was made in meters, piping, and water access and quantity, service delivery, O&M, and response to customer’s complaints improved, and there was an increase in billing and collection rates (up to 80% paying) and an increase in revenues. When the project was approved, tariffs for customers were only just being reintroduced. This increase in revenue was not maintained post the project investment and collections have declined since project completion, with only 12% of customers (5000) having meter readings under the Dili public system as of June 2018 (from PCR meetings) and of these, only approximately 4% are making payments. There is no penalty for non–payment and disconnections do not occur and the incentive for payment, given on average 5–8 hours supply in many zones, is limited. This decrease reflects the declining service provision in many zones, the lack of a regular O&M program with only major repairs being addressed, the lack of regulation on illegal connections, and the hours of water delivery being allocated for short periods of the day. In the project zones, when pumps broke down, they were not immediately repaired, and with low-pressure water, customers get poor service and have little incentive to pay. The payment system is time-consuming and has not been streamlined."

0,"Regulated revenue from new assets. As noted above, most of the incremental revenue earned by the DISCOMs for the new distribution facilities is calculated in accordance with regulations set by MPERC. MPERC allows DISCOMs to recover electricity purchase costs, interest costs, depreciation charges, O&M costs, working capital charges and corporate taxes in end-use tariffs.2 A return on invested equity of 16% (post-tax) is also included in the annual revenue allowance. Any assets that are brought in to service are added to the distributor's regulatory asset base, and this results in increases in revenue allowances for return on equity, depreciation and interest costs. The principle underpinning these revenue regulations is that distributors should earn at least their cost of capital on its investments (subject to some side constraints). That is, in principle the FIRR on efficient capital investments should equal (at least) the WACC (without taking into account any other benefits that might arise)."
1,"Design and build contract. Civil works contracts were on a design-and-build basis. While design-and-build contracts tend to suit governments, they can also lead to scope changes during implementation and a prolonged preconstruction period. Fortunately, the scope changes for this project were not major and the extra costs were fully covered by the project contingency. For similar projects in the future, project preparation at appraisal should be strengthened, especially for projects that present topographic and geological challenges. Adequate contingencies should also be built into the cost estimations for such projects, and the selected contractors should be skilled at carrying out detailed design."

Though innovative, it was difficult to achieve given the weak capacity of small NGOs and high fiduciary risks. Achieving the overall intended project outcomes required an executing agency with strong implementation capacity, but this became unavailable due to the discontinuation and re-establishment of executing agency. The project undertook a major scope change, which reduced the number of implementing NGOs to 29 and the number of MOPAs to 6 but kept most of output performance indicators unchanged. Although the project reformulation improved project relevance, it was inadequate. The project implementation remained slow due to lengthy recruitment of NGOs.

In  all,  ADB  approved 45 resettlement plans during MFF implementation, of which 33 resettlement plans were implemented while 12 resettlement plans were not required to be implemented as the anticipated impacts were avoided in nine subprojects and three subprojects were dropped. Under project 3, four resettlement plans were not required to be implemented as anticipated impacts in the wastewater subprojects at Chittorgarh and Bharatpur were avoided while solid waste management subproject in Sikar and heritage subproject in Chittorgarh were dropped from the project scope; and 11 resettlement plans were finally implemented. All 33 resettlement plans implemented under the MFF were in compliance with applicable social safeguards requirements of ADB and government legislation. There was no change in impacts during the implementation of the resettlement plans other than variation in number of affected households, which were regularly updated and reflected in the revised resettlement plans."

By the loan closing date of 30 September 2017, the cost was $50.9 million, which includes $42.2 million (82.9%) contributed by ADB, and $8.7 million (17.1%) by the government (Appendix 3, Table A3.5 and A3.6). Due to the reduction in the overall project cost resulting from changes in the design of civil works, ADB canceled the surplus unallocated loan amount of $14 million on 8 May 2017. The major change was the reduction in civil works cost from $60 million to $44.5 million. Following the approval of $73 million for project 3 on 13 December 2012, the balance MFF amount of $129 million still available, and the remaining period of about 4.5 years were not sufficient to finance the next prepared project.

0,"At completion, the economic benefits expected at appraisal were not confirmed to have realized although almost all the outputs were achieved. This was primarily because of a non- functional Network Operating Center (NOC) at Siliguri in India, which resulted in SASECRN not providing cross-border data exchange. Although Bhutan in 2016 and Nepal in 2017 discontinued use of the satellite for communication, before the completion of the SASECRN component in December 2017, these countries had had already made separate arrangements for access to Internet through the service providers like Airtel, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited in India outside the project. 52 Probably in this backdrop, no ISP in Bhutan showed interest in utilizing the SASECRN infrastructure for commercial purpose when solicited by the EA in 2014. As a result, no economic benefits of savings in the cost of connecting to internet service in Bhutan and Nepal nor incremental revenues that were to be accrued to India and Bangladesh paid by Nepal and Bhutan for connection to internet through the CLS of SASECRN established in the latter two countries, were measurable for the purpose of economic analysis at completion."

0,"Based on the assumptions and parameters above, the EIRR was calculated for a period of 28 years (2008–2035), including 11 years for project implementation and 21 years for operation (with some overlaps of construction and operation periods). 50% of the capital cost was considered as the residual value of the expressway, which was added to the last calculation year. The EIRR was recalculated at 18.4% for the whole project expressway, respectively 19.1% for the HCMC–Long Thanh section and 16.0% for the Long Thanh–Dau Giay section. The higher EIRR for the HCMC–Long Thanh section was mainly caused by a higher traffic level. In comparing the EIRR at appraisal (15% for the whole project), the higher EIRR at completion was mainly due to a lower capital cost and higher traffic level. The recalculated EIRRs are above the ADB recommended discount rate of 12% at appraisal. The project is therefore considered to be continuously economically viable. The details of the economic reevaluation are in Table 13.6."

0,"After the completion of the interventions in the target sub-zones, the surrounding sub- zones also wanted improved water supply. So, under social and political pressure, the water control valves were opened, which resulted in the decline of service delivery, water pressure, and quality of service. As a result, the initial improvement in billing collection also declined. Combined with this was a lack of or inadequate ongoing O&M, with a maintenance approach that prioritized critical repairs only. Illegal connections were not actively controlled or regulated once the project zones were completed. Major damage that occurred to completed project work during implementation was not always repaired. This occurred in zone 10 when a road project damaged 2 km of pipe, which was only patched up and resulted in the eastern part of zone 10 getting a poor-quality service. Five years later, the pipe is still to be properly repaired. Likewise, in zone 1 (sub-zone 4), technical design issues with incorrect bore flow capacity estimates and poor piping connections to leaking existing pipelines were identified during contract implementation. These issues resulted in the target households receiving limited water for a short, defined period of the day due to low pressure. These problems have not been rectified."

0,"The project experienced a cost overrun during implementation resulting from improved engineering design and price escalation. Consequently, the government requested additional financing to achieve the project’s intended outputs while improving technical quality. Additional engineering measures were by their nature an integral part of ongoing civil works, and additional financing was deemed the most suitable approach (other options were restructuring, scaling down, or canceling the project). The development objectives of the project remained unchanged with the additional financing, and the project was expected to remain technically, economically, and financially viable despite the cost overrun.

Annual incidence of sanitation-related diseases decreased by nearly 38% as against a 20% target in the 13 ULBs where sanitation subprojects were undertaken. Sanitation improvements have led to overall public health improvements, and in particular impacted poor people, with reduced burden of diseases, treatment costs, and productive losses. However, the long-term impacts of addressing deficiencies in environmental sanitation on reducing high morbidity and mortality amongst poor people can be quantified at a later stage. Over 375,547 BPL people have benefitted with access to improved urban infrastructure services, which constitutes 21% as against the 20% target. Drainage interventions have significantly reduced flooding in low-lying areas, and urban transport interventions have improved the riding quality and pedestrian safety and reduced traffic congestion, travel times, and vehicle operating costs, thus contributing to improvement in the health and urban environment quality and thereby contributing toward achieving the strategic objectives of the project.

Overall the TA outcome was achieved. The TA activities contributed to improving the environment for women entrepreneurs in Armenia. The TA is rated as highly effective. Though there is no available gender disaggregated data on the number of new women businesses registered (DMF indicator, using the Business Registry) Armenia has improved in other proxy indicators (female participation in firms’ ownership increased from 11.5% in 2005 to 25.3% in 2013 and the percentage of firms with female top managers increased from 13.5% in 2009 to 19.1% in 2013).e Armenia also now tops the ranking of Eastern European countries in its support to women entrepreneurs.f The TA also helped achieve the policy actions required for the disbursement of the second tranche (see Progress Report on Tranche Release) and deliver two of the outputs of the overall program Design and Monitoring Framework. Under output 1 of the program (“Improved institutional framework supports women entrepreneurs and MSMEs”), the TA assisted the Ministry of Economy define action plans linked to the national strategy for SME development targeted at women entrepreneurs and MSMEs. Under Output 2 (“Improved capacity of women entrepreneurs and MSMEs”): (i) the target of 3,500 women to receive training and business development services from SME DNC was achieved by the end of 2016 (4,584); and (ii) 51% of the participants in SME DNC start up programs were women and presented a business plan to a financial institution and 54% of them obtained funding (above the 30% target in the DMF). The TA is rated as successful. The TA exceeded its objectives and activities and is likely to be sustainable as the policy and operational changes triggered with the TA support are all being implemented. The Armenian government is now recognized for the attention it gives to support women entrepreneurship and some of the initiatives supported by the TA (e.g. annual need assessment survey to ensure quality of services provided, and new mentoring and coaching schemes) have been recognized by the OECD as good examples to be replicated in other countries in the region.g Additionally several Armenian business support organizations are now using the tools and methodologies piloted by SME DNC with the support of the TA. a ADB. 2012.

Participating SMEs faced challenges, including the length of the approval process which required several inputs from the companies yet left the final selection to chance (lottery). The use of a lottery may also have compromised the achievement of gender targets. Overall, this type of grant program would benefit from stronger and sustained outreach, awareness building and capacity development regarding the formulation of business plans. Disbursement processes should be easy to use and timely. Finally, targeting remains an open question as post completion surveys found that smaller, non-registered SMEs had a more acute need for such support. Alternatively, these SMEs also present unfair competition to registered SMEs as they do not consistently observe local laws and standards."

0,"The Citarum River Basin (CRB) is in the province of West Java and covers 13,000 square kilometers (km2). The government of Indonesia considers it the most strategic river basin territory in the country because it provides 80% of the surface water supply to the capital city of Jakarta.1 In 2008 the CRB supported a population of more than 28 million people and 20% of the country’s industrial output. The upper basin has three hydroelectric dams producing a total of 1,400 megawatts. The river feeds irrigation covering close to 400,000 hectares (ha) that produce 5% of the country’s rice. Over the past two decades the basin’s water resources have come under increased pressure from urbanization and industrial growth, causing severe water pollution and acute stress and depletion of groundwater in several locations. Rapid urbanization and climate change have significantly increased vulnerability to floods. Environmental degradation has also reached levels that compromise public health and livelihoods, particularly for the poor. Sustainable management of the basin’s river and groundwater became critical to the social and economic development of the country.2"

So, under social and political pressure, the control valves were opened, and service delivery, pressure, and quality of service declined (paras. 11 to 14). As a result, the initial improvement in billing collection also declined. Combined with this was inadequate ongoing O&M and the lack  of active regulation of illegal connections once the project zones were completed, and this resulted in high NRW losses.

The February 2009 ADB review mission and RGC recognized the obstacles in the domestic availability of good quality seeds, as commercial production of seeds was constrained by the shortage of foundation seeds (a problem with only a medium-term solution). Accordingly, it was accepted that proceeding with the original implementation targets under serious supply and time constraints would be unrealistic. It was agreed in a MOU between ADB and RGC that the maximum quantity of subsidized rice seed provided under the project would be 2,000 tons (and a linked and proportionate volume of fertilizers would be supplied, to the cost of about $2m) and that this would be implemented on a pilot basis. Given the overall financial scaling back of the output, about $10.3m was therefore available for reallocation (within the project scope itself – i.e., on outputs 1 and 3 - and/or to other projects); the cost of this revised design of output 2 was now expected to be about $3.5m. These changes were reflected in the Major Change of Scope of 22 June 2009."
0,"Information disclosure and grievance redress: A grievance redress mechanism was set up wherein the city level committees chaired by district collectors also functioned as the grievance redress committees. Routine grievances were mainly related to removal of debris, backfilling of open pits, restoration of roads and footpaths, choking of drains, etc. The Project staff responded to these grievances in a reasonable time frame and obtained feedback from the complainants about resolution prior to closing the grievance log. In 2012, ADB responded to a complaint from an agency, Gharial Conservation Alliance, claiming regulatory non-compliance and inadequate environmental assessment in the IEE report for Dholpur. ADB investigated the complaint by obtaining additional information from IPMU, which confirmed that the intake works (not an ADB-financed subproject), being executed by the Public Health and Engineering Department, Government of Rajasthan in Dholpur, was located within the boundaries of National Chambal Sanctuary. The ADB-financed water treatment plant at Dholpur sources raw water from a ground level storage reservoir, which receives water from the intake works. During ground truthing, ADB found that all requisite regulatory compliances had been obtained by Public Health and Engineering Department and were in order. Accordingly, the IEE reports were updated to include the National Chambal Sanctuary. Within a reasonable time, ADB consulted and obtained feedback from the complainant about resolution prior to closing the grievance log."

Ten MOH officers from various departments were assigned to senior management and technical roles, including the program director and two vice directors. The part-time nature of these three senior roles and the requirement for incumbents to balance program and MOH workloads was flagged as a difficulty. The PMU was staffed by a further 14 full-time personnel, supplemented by national and international consultants."

1,"Procurement: The PPRR mission also reviewed the process for procurement of civil works and contractors. For the civil works contracts, the mission identified weaknesses in how proposals were evaluated. Weaknesses included unclear documentation of evaluation results and line of credit concerns. For the consultancy contacts, the main issues were (i) application of shortlisting criteria was not clear, (ii) inconsistent ratings for few national experts, and (iii) lack of relevant supporting documentation to substantiate the eligibility of experts. To help ensure smoother procurement in future projects in Tajikistan, the PPRR mission has proposed several recommendations. These recommendations include holding training courses on ADB procurement procedures and providing regular updates on changes to the procurement guidelines to the MOT and PIU staff."

The dollar equivalent of the program loan rose by 4% compared with the appraisal amount because the SDR appreciated. The project loan and grant did not have significant overruns or underruns. Reallocations were made because of the (i) change in scope of the benchmarking and costing activity for care pathways; (ii) procurement of additional laboratory equipment packages for an expanded number of HPTIs, sourced from the unallocated grant amount; and (iii) implementation of a competency-based curriculum for nursing. Underspent amounts were a result of reduced spending on scholarships, the consolidation of consulting services requirements, lower actual costs for workshops and trainings, and several activities being funded through other government and development partner programs. At completion, $1.20 million of the loan and $0.60 million of the grant were undisbursed and subsequently cancelled. Total program costs are in Appendixes 7 and 8."

Incremental financial costs would be incurred from O&M, meter reading, and billing. Based on the above improvements being implemented, the combined financial analysis of the three sub-zone projects was estimated and had a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 2.5%. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was estimated at 1%, which indicated the sub-projects would  be financially viable."

The project and the MFF remained relevant to Strategy 2020, which focused on one of core areas of infrastructure development, including water resources management and the delivery of efficient and sustainable irrigation.20 R&U of vital irrigation infrastructure through reforms initiatives, and agriculture productivity investments remained a key strategic thrust in the country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2009–201321, and the country partnership strategy for Pakistan 2015–2019.22 The Government of Punjab’s Medium- Term Development Framework, 2012–2015 aimed at modernizing existing irrigation infrastructure and implementing broad-based reforms to improve service delivery. The Punjab Growth Strategy 2018 acknowledged reliance on irrigation and regarded the project as one of the key investments in improving the irrigation infrastructure.23 The government and ADB overcame implementation challenges. Timely changes in the institutional changes design aligned the project with the overall reforms environment in Punjab and to new area water board and farmer organizations’ rules. This maintained project relevance and government ownership (para. 14). The selection of the MFF modality was the correct approach as ADB’s experience shows that farmer organizations’ development is a long-term process. The project provided a comprehensive groundwater knowledge base, strategic framework and plan. This contribution is aligned with the government’s ongoing initiative in groundwater management (para.11)."

The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of the subprojects identified at appraisal were reevaluated as follows: (i) water supply, Chittorgarh 29.6% (appraisal 17.8%); (ii) wastewater, Bharatpur 15.9% (appraisal 13.2%); (iii) urban drainage, Sawai Madhopur 14.5% (appraisal 16.4%); (iv) urban transport, Sawai Madhopur 14.2% (appraisal 14.0%) (Appendix 10). All subprojects were evaluated at completion and the EIRRs ranged from 12.6% to 39.4%, all being above the 12.0% threshold. The estimated EIRRs of the main project components at completion  were  water  supply 26.4%,  wastewater 14.3%,  and  urban  transport 16.7%. The estimated EIRR for the total project combining all subprojects was 18.3%. With a 20% reduction in future benefits, the project EIRR remained above the threshold. Although estimated at appraisal, the EIRR at completion was not assessed for the Bundi SWM subproject as the sanitary landfill was dropped. The EIRRs for firefighting and heritage subprojects were not estimated at appraisal and not assessed at completion. The economic net present value for assessed subprojects at completion are positive, applying a 12% discount rate. The delays in execution of some contracts (para. 30) did not affect the EIRRs as they were counterbalanced by efficient contract award and funds disbursements and increased service area coverage and project ULBs. The institutional efficiencies and grievance redress mechanisms developed in ULBs and line agencies reduced transaction costs and time, improved transparency and accountability of governance, and significantly augmented administrative capacities of respective institutions (paras. 21 and 39). The MFF is rated efficient, with the EIRR of the major components for all tranches estimated at 24.5% for water supply, 15.8% for wastewater and drainage, and 17.6% for urban transport.

After the trainings, the women participants report gaining confidence in performing job related tasks. (ii) All workshops included discussions on the key gender issues (such as women’s participation, setting up quotas for women participation during capacity development trainings, discussion on women’s issues and why sex-disaggregated data is a necessary component in project implementation, monitoring and reporting). Traditionally, it was mostly only men participating in the trainings and workshops. This could be attributed to culture and traditional practices on limiting women’s mobility and voice. This project met the target on gender quota for women’s attendance in the trainings to ensure that equitable opportunities were provided to women. The project facilitated women’s participation and created opportunities for women for improving their status in their workplaces and in their communities.

In case of ongoing breaches in financial covenants, ADB should conduct an  updated financial analysis to evaluate whether ongoing reforms have a positive impact on the  financial strength of the entity. A model to derive a tariff trajectory for various categories of supply  reaching cost recovery after an acceptable number of years is also needed along with a possible  support program to mitigate the shock effect of the required tariff increases.

This exercise not only provided strong evidence of current gender issues existing in the vocational training setting but also provided specific and realistic recommendations to what extent and how the project will address these gender issues to avoid setting up too high female targets. The findings of the gender analysis will be also used to identify appropriated gender targets and actions as well as an approach to achieve these gender indicators for each vocational college. In addition, gender targets in TVET registration should be based on the experience of what is possible within each TVET program. Setting unreasonable targets for female enrolment in TVET programs leads to the targets being ignored as simply impossible. This has the effect of diminishing the importance of Gender goals and undermines the credibility of Gender inputs. Gender analysis should also figure out what are the hidden reasons that challenge women participation in the nontraditional field and female leadership is limited.

1,"Liquidation of ADB loan advance. To facilitate LAR activities, the related districts established five SGIAs and the VEC transferred a large amount of advance loan proceeds to them. The VEC and ADB’s due diligence overestimated LAR costs and the district government could not provide eligible supporting documents for some expenses (mainly for procurement for utility shifting), so the related districts had to liquidate some advance funds, around $18 million, according to an ADB letter in October 2016. The liquidation took a long time because of a long verification process which checked whether the relocation of public utilities was eligible for ADB financing. As a result, the winding-up period was extended three times, thus postponing the closing of the loan financial account to November 2018 (around two years after the loan closed). It is suggested that ADB and the executing agency ensure accurate cost estimates for LAR and carefully arrange and monitor how SGIAs are established and used."

ADB then conducts its project due diligence after this project milestone, and often finds major design errors and omissions, both technical and related to safeguard mitigation measures which, if rectified, could significantly improve the quality of the project. These errors and omissions often require an increase in the project budget, which in turn may require additional time for government-internal approval and further delaying project preparation and implementation. If the project design requires ADB to base the project’s preparation on a government-prepared feasibility study, ADB should begin its project due diligence activities concurrently with the government’s feasibility study, to include the final design phase. This will help ensure that the design and budget are properly developed in accordance with international standards, and that safeguard measures are properly integrated into the project design."

0,"The pilot was tested at a group of 34 hospitals (district, provincial, and central) during 2014 with the objective of determining the effects on the average length of stay (ALOS) in days for 30 specific sets of medical cases (of which 24 had comparable data). For the complete data set,7 there were over 200,000 cases without the CP program and just under 4,000 cases in the CP program. The “without CP” and “with CP” data sets each had a different case mix; each case has a different length of stay. Thus, for comparability, the case mix is held constant by rebasing it to the “with CP” case mix. The “with CP” ALOS was about one whole day shorter that the “without CP” average length of stay (Table A15.5). Disaggregating the data indicated that three quarters of the case types and 90% of cases showed improvement in ALOS (Table A15.6).

While the project made earnest efforts to support the strengthening of provincial S&R systems, an assessment of full compliance with IHR–APSED at national level is being conducted only now. A joint external evaluation with WHO revealed that national compliance had improved substantially in the CLV countries, although progress varied, and to reach full compliance, the countries need to further strengthen their human resource capacity, intersectoral collaboration and coordination, and formalization and documentation of procedures. More investment and time would be needed before the provinces achieve IHR compliance. As for the mass administration of micronutrients and deworming drugs, these programs were already supported by other development partners such as WHO and the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), and the governments had regular funding for these programs. The less than 100% achievements on this indicator, particularly in the Lao PDR, suggest that more investment is indeed needed. Joint cross-border activities were conducted satisfactorily under the project. However, the agreement to conduct cross-border activities by cluster provinces18 for efficiency may have limited the opportunities for districts to fully participate. In addition, joint cross-border simulation exercises require substantial resources and coordination to organize. It is clear that cross-border activities were conducted mainly in the form of information-sharing meetings, while only one joint simulation exercise between Cambodia and Lao PDR border provinces in the central cluster was carried out. However, it is concluded that partial achievements of these output targets do not affect the overall effectiveness of the project."

The FIL and the PBL complemented each other well and in combination they contributed to the outcome of the program—i.e., an improved environment for women entrepreneurs in Armenia. The PBL component was essential to create an enabling environment for women entrepreneurs’ growth, and this was done by undertaking key reforms to strengthen SME DNC’s corporate governance and coordinating functions. As a result, SME DNC developed several programs and action plans for MSMEs and women entrepreneurs. The PBL also improved the readiness of the women MSMEs by providing necessary training and BDS support. It likewise made it easier to start up a business with the reduction of cost of doing business for MSMEs. The FIL component was key to providing the liquidity needed to deliver financing to women entrepreneurs in this improved enabling environment.

Going forward, the sustainability of road projects in PNG will depend on the capacity of the NRA, or its successor, and on the existence of sufficient funds for road maintenance. According to the project design, improving the capacity and effectiveness of the NRA will be critical to ensuring the success of the overall investment program. Although the government failed to sufficiently top up the road user fund during project 1, the government provided budget support to the DOW for road maintenance. The government has also passed policies that demonstrate its commitment to ensuring the future operation and maintenance of project roads. The government, together with its development partners (including ADB, Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the European Union) is examining how it can strengthen institutional arrangements to sustainably manage all national and provincial roads. This includes a review of the organizational future of the NRA. The core function of the NRA is to maintain more than 2,000 km of priority national and provincial roads. The DOW and district and local governments are actively maintaining other roads. The long-term maintenance contracts under the two civil works packages awarded under project 1 continue to be effective.

A summary environmental impact assessment was prepared and disclosed 120 days prior to Board approval in accordance with the Environment Policy (2002). Anticipated environmental impacts were mainly associated with formation cutting and road opening, and impacts to wildlife and biodiversity, particularly portions that pass through sensitive habitat areas. The latter was addressed through the construction of wildlife underpasses and signage for elephant crossing. Most impacts were short-term, reversible, confined to the construction stage of the project and could be minimized and addressed through mitigation measures included in the engineering design and the environmental management plan (EMP).

0,"Analysis of the design and monitoring frameworks (DMFs) for project 1 and project 2 with respect to the facility DMF are dealt with in the respective project completion reports.12 Project 1 did not have an individual DMF and there were inconsistencies between the performance indicators across the facility and tranche DMFs. The facility outcome indicator requiring ULBs to generate adequate revenues from own sources to meet all of their own expenses is inconsistent with the risk assessment and mitigation measures and the assurances sought from, provided by, and met by the GOR. This outcome indicator, along with that on ULBs’ ownership of assets and responsibilities per the 74th constitutional amendment, were dropped from project 2 and project 3 DMFs. Six water treatment plants (WTPs); the STP at Baran; road-over bridges (ROBs) at Bundi, Nagaur, and Sikar; and the social infrastructure component in the facility DMF were not covered under any of the tranche DMFs. Some of the outcome indicators for urban drainage, urban transport, and firefighting services are defined in the project 3 DMF as output indicators. The facility DMF was not updated to reflect the inclusion of the firefighting component under project 3. Also, the project 3 DMF does not define the outcomes intended from the output interventions for firefighting services and support infrastructure for cultural heritage components. Though the overall objective of the MFF and its projects are the same in terms of impacts, outcomes, and outputs, there are variations in the respective performance indicators between the MFF and the projects. Performance of the water supply, drainage, and urban transport subprojects are measured differently in the DMFs of project 3 and the facility, resulting in the same output being measured under multiple parameters in the two DMFs, impacting accuracy of overall performance assessment. The indicator used to measure declining trends in poverty in the ULBs in the facility DMF is the population living below the poverty line (BPL), which is available at national and state level only and not at ULB level (para. 45) and has not been used in any of the project DMFs. The wastewater outputs under the facility DMF covered only 12 ULBs (1.4 million people) while the corresponding outcome targeted 100% of the population in 15 ULBs (1.6 million people).

The momentum for streamlining institutional reforms in irrigation management was created with client counterparts and in partnership with development partners. The project improved land through irrigation services, drainage, and flood management in the LBDC command area (700,000 ha), the area served by the Balloki Barrage through the Balloki–Sulemanki Link Canal (1,250,000 ha), and the flood-prone area adjacent to the right bank of the Balloki Barrage. Cropping intensity has improved over the last 10 years. The project beneficiaries include farmers who have a limited income from small landholdings and subsistence farming.

Prior to this, ADB had already approved two loans for state highway development in Madhya Pradesh.4 A TA for project preparation was provided to support project readiness and support due diligence in the project design and preconstruction activities.5 Lessons from previous projects, especially from the two earlier ADB projects, were incorporated in the project design. This project was ADB’s third intervention for highway development in the state, and was included in the country operations business plan (2011–2013).6 The project aimed to rehabilitate the parts of the state highway network that had not been upgraded and enhance the road safety capacity of MPRDC, with the purpose of transforming it into a full-fledged state highway agency by building on its success as an implementing agency. Based on lessons learned and the achievements of the previous two projects in the state, the project was designed to facilitate efficient and sustainable transport operations by improving the identified roads and also : (i) minimizing the impact of climate change through proper engineering design and measures towards sustainability as ""green"" highways, (ii) addressing road safety through modern technology, (iii) incorporating suggestions on road safety based on gender consultations and the promotion of gender awareness, and (iv) preparing a long- term strategy for private sector participation in road network development and maintenance. Adequate consultations with stakeholders were conducted during the design stage, including with women. All the subprojects were fully prepared during appraisal, and so the project lending modality was adopted. The design and monitoring framework (DMF) indicators were logical and appropriate, but could have been improved to include specific outcome indicators on sustainability and the strategy for private sector participation. Nonetheless, those are inherently included in the outcome statement of sustainable transport operations. The DMF with results is in Appendix 1."

As noted in the DMF, the success of the project depended on enhanced connectivity for the entire road network, including non-project roads adjoining the project road sections. As no firm plans are in place to rehabilitate roads not financed by the project, this essential assumption was not met. The completed road sections appear as a disparate collection of unconnected provincial roads; relatively short project road sections alternate with unimproved non-project sections, thus reducing benefits.

For the loan fund, the project cost at appraisal was $30 million, including ADB loan financing of $27 million and government counterpart funding of $3 million; at completion, the project cost was $28.40 million, or 94.67% of the appraisal because of the appreciation of the special drawing right, loan savings, and less counterpart funding. For the additional financing, the project cost at appraisal was estimated at $10.1 million, including grant financing of $9.5 million from the Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund (RMTF) under the Health Financing Partnership Facility,13 and government counterpart funding of $0.6 million. At completion, the project cost was $9.02 million, or 94.94% of the appraisal because of partial cancellations, grant savings, and less counterpart funding. The project fully utilized ADB funds to support all components except taxes and duties for laboratory and office equipment and vehicles, which were borne by the CLV governments. Reallocations were done to increase allocations for training, community mobilization, and consulting services during implementation. The partial cancellations resulted from unused funds in G0450 (VIE); the implementation of additional financing was shorter in Viet Nam (13 months only) due to start-up delay.

The grant focused on biodiversity inventory, habitat restoration, payment for ecosystem services (PES), and mainstreaming biodiversity in the production landscape in eight conservation areas. Biodiversity inventory and habitat mapping were conducted as the basis to develop the biodiversity management action plans in the conservation areas. The maps in those areas were updated using high-resolution satellite imagery. A web-based management information system (MIS) was also developed. The staff of the MOEFr involved in conservation area management benefited from the capacity-building program to better implement the biodiversity management action plans. The project supported a restoration and land rehabilitation pilot covering 106.3 ha of degraded forest. A road map for ecosystem conservation and restoration which covered four conservation areas of approximately 1,551 ha was produced, with cost estimates based on various levels of ecosystem degradation. Four hundred villagers involved in conservation model groups benefited from training in composting, seedbed-nursery and participatory restoration monitoring and evaluation. Three voluntary PES schemes were piloted between water users and conservation village groups upstream. One pilot PES has been formalized through an agreement between a water-user group that extracts water from springs and the upstream conservation village community group. The grant supported the establishment of 13 conservation village models (CVMs). The community training covered entrepreneurship, organic farming, and composting. Along with the conservation village program, alternative livelihoods were also developed. The effectiveness of management of conservation areas before and after the project was measured by biodiversity tracking tools, which are generally increased in each of the conservation areas.

DISCOMs can recover electricity purchase costs in accordance with MPERC’s loss trajectories. If DISCOMs achieve loss levels lower than the trajectories set by MPERC, they retain the saving in electricity purchase costs. Conversely, if DISCOMs cannot meet MPERC’s distribution loss trajectories, some electricity 1 The Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company Limited (MPPMCL) has implemented an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution as part of Project 6. This entity recovers its costs by way of a margin on power trades to the three DISCOMs and operates on a no-profit / no-loss basis. In this context and given its small size relative to the overall Project 6 investment (approximately 3% of the capital cost of Project 6), the implementation of ERP at MPPMCL has not been included in this financial analysis. 2 The annual revenue requirement (ARR) is the total electricity revenue that the jurisdictional regulator has agreed to allow the electricity distributor to recover during the subsequent year. The tariff that is subsequently calculated is just the mean by which the ARR is recovered from customers. The DISCOMs are not incentivized to under-forecast sales quantity (and thereby increase tariff) because over-recovery of revenue (compared to the ARR) is recovered in subsequent years (by way of a reduction in ARR). purchase costs cannot be recovered from customers and instead have to be absorbed by the DISCOMs.3 MP DISCOMs have struggled meet MPERC’s loss trajectories and this has been the main cause of DISCOMs’ financial losses. Components 1 and 2 of the investment reduced total energy losses by an estimated 617 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per annum.4 This loss reduction results in incremental net revenue to DISCOM-C. With the state moving to energy and capacity surpluses from FY2015, loss reduction accrues as a reduction in unfunded electricity purchases (that is, electricity purchases that DISCOM-C cannot recover from customers by way of regulated revenue), and this was valued at the DISCOMs’ average variable electricity purchase cost in FY2015 of approximately ₹2.9 per kWh (assumed constant in real terms beyond FY2015). Tariff regulations allow DISCOM-C to retain two-thirds of the value of this loss reduction [footnote 31], resulting in net incremental revenue of approximately ₹1,176 million per year by FY 2018 in addition to the regulated incremental revenue arising from the DISCOM’s increased regulatory asset bases (discussed in the preceding paragraph)."

To avoid complications, DSC and NUC incorporated buffer tanks into the design specification to isolate the new generators from the existing system. The primary electrical challenge was related to the compatibility of the earthing arrangements for the new system and the existing one. The solution was to introduce step-down transformers between the new generators and switchgear, as well as to adjust one of the existing generator’s neutral earthing arrangements. Nauru’s natural environment is known to be hard on generators and to shorten their life. To address this issue, the design specified that the generators be fully enclosed to protect them from the inhospitable conditions.

0,Study on the use of wildlife crossings. ADB is funding a study on the wildlife underpasses which will run for two years. 7 This study will cover all underpasses and will include oversized culverts to determine the effectivity of these structures as wildlife crossings. Camera traps will be set up to observe wildlife movements across these structures. This study will be a valuable contribution to the knowledge on the use of underpasses in road projects in South Asia where information is currently lacking. 7 The study will be funded under TA 9461 REG: Protecting and Investing in Natural Capital in Asia and Pacific.
0,"The project is considered likely sustainable because of growing infrastructure investment  needs and continued priority given by the government to energy conservation and environmental  improvement. More importantly, heating tariff reform—supported through the institutional reform  and corporate governance subcomponent (component D)—created a foundation to transform  heating project sustainability. Building on the project, ADB is supporting two projects to help  expand district heating systems in IMAR (para. 43). Thus, despite a delay in achieving the  outcomes, the project is rated successful (Appendix 12)."
0,"The estimate of economic viability is reasonably robust on these assumptions, in that it would take something exceeding 20% reduction in area, yield or paddy economic price (all of whose effects are equivalent) to make the EIRR fall below 9%.11"
0,average wet season rice yields rose by about 34% and dry season yields rose by 68% (the figures for non-target farmers in the same provinces were 21% and 43% respectively)
1,"Despite some critical issues, the project was successfully completed as designed and its outcome and outputs were substantially achieved. The following issues and lessons were, nevertheless, identified:"
0,"Trade facilitation and tourism development. At the time of the PCR mission, the entire Bishkek–Torugart road had been improved, which has effectively and efficiently facilitated international trade and traffic. The total value of trade between the Kyrgyz Republic and the PRC increased by a factor of about 50 from 2000 to 2015. Along with improvement of transport conditions, traffic on the project road has increased rapidly according to visual observations and traffic surveys. The traffic includes heavy cargo trucks and international tourists traveling on one of the routes of the Silk Road, in addition to PRC and Kyrgyz Republic residents traveling back and forth on scheduled bus services. Traffic development requires both adequate infrastructure and improved trade facilitation. Logistics development along the road corridor still needs enhancement, such as reducing custom clearance processing times, providing more secure sites for road users, and facilitating international tourism by providing proper rest stops."
0,"The reevaluation illustrates that both roads are economically viable, with the EIRR for the Mendi–Kandep road estimated at 17.8%, and the EIRR for the Laiagam–Porgera road estimated at 17.7%. This compares with the extant EIRR estimate of 16.5% for each road section. The Mendi–Kandep road is assessed as more sensitive to changes in key assumptions than the Laiagam–Porgera road. The viability of the Laiagam–Porgera road is comparatively insensitive to increases in capital cost and reductions in traffic. Notably, the viability of both roads is comparatively insensitive to assumptions of a combined reduction in maintenance and traffic. Cost overruns of 8% and 16% are not considered significant. The 10-month delay in completing construction beyond the 30-month construction schedule also does not appear to have affected outcomes. The report and recommendation of the president also noted that the proposed road works were economically justifiable even with a 20% increase in construction costs and a 20% reduction in traffic. Details of the economic reevaluation are in Appendix 10."
1,Other areas for monitoring. The continuity of RDM staff who are involved in implementation of PFMRP; and improved incentives particularly given low salary for public employees will further strengthen sustainability.
1,"The project received a grant of $9.5 million in additional financing to contain artemisinin- resistant malaria after it was found in 2008 along the Thai–Cambodian border. With the additional financing, the scope of the project was expanded to include malaria-related activities and performance indicators in the DMF. The project closing date was extended from 30 June 2016 to 31 December 2017. The additional financing enhanced the relevance of the project design since it addressed the unique challenge of drug-resistant malaria in the GMS and provided timely support to limit the potential spread of drug-resistant malaria from the GMS to other regions."
1,"During implementation, project funding complemented national programs that receive regular government funding and funding from other partners. Interventions at provincial and district levels were integrated into their operational plans with regular funding. Recurrent costs were estimated to be a small share of total health sector budget (Appendix 11). The project strengthened health system management functions in project provinces, including planning, budgeting, and strengthening primary health care through the MHVs and community health networks, which will benefit health programs and projects in the long term. The ongoing ADB- financed GMS Health Security Project (footnote 17) also continues to support IHR capacity development, particularly as regards laboratory capacities, cross-border collaboration, and IHR core capacities. GMS countries (including the People’s Republic of China and Thailand) endorsed in December 2018 the GMS Health Cooperation Strategy 2019–2023, consolidating long-term CDC experience in the subregion and aiming for a more inclusive approach to ensuring greater health security in the future. This development is another opportunity to sustain a regional cooperation platform for CDC."
0,"Works were divided into 10 packages: two pilot packages, two Balloki Barrage packages, three LBDC packages, and three distribution system packages—one in each of Okara, Sahiwal, and Khanewal. Later, the two Balloki Barrage packages were merged in one package and the Khanewal distribution system was split into two packages. The average award time taken for civil works was about 21 months (Appendix 8, Table A8.5). The performance of contractors, and design and construction supervision consultants remained generally weak in construction management and contract administration. All the contracts, except for two, exceeded their contract period. Component 3 consultants mostly completed their assignments at the scheduled time. The PMU support consultants provided much-needed support during the last 3 years of the project when the PMU could not refill vacant positions and remained preoccupied with preparing new subprojects during the transition to the PMO Canals."
0,"The project is rated successful overall based on its ratings on the four core evaluation  criteria.22 It is rated highly relevant, because the project is fully aligned with the government's  priority of strengthening endangered reservoirs; the PRC's Five-Year Plan, 2006–2010 and Five- Year Plan, 2011–2015; the ADB PRC CPSs for 2008–2010 and 2011–2015; and the ADB water  policy and ADB water operational plan. The rating of effective is based on achievement of the  project's intended outcome and substantial achievement of the output targets. It is rated efficient  in light of the efficiency of the investment, and highly efficient implementation process. It is rated  likely sustainable based on several factors: increased funds from various sources to cover O&M,  flood management, and staff salaries; positive results of the financial sustainability analysis;  adequate staff capacity for and continuing training on reservoir operations; the absence of  adverse environmental and social impacts; completed and ongoing activities to disseminate  sustainable reservoir rehabilitation and management models; and replication of the models  outside Shandong (this is not yet confirmed)."
0,"The project is rated less than effective. The output targets of all three components at appraisal were substantially achieved. However, the regional network did not achieve a permanent, functional regional internet connectivity. It is therefore difficult to assess the project’s contribution to the outcomes, and hence its effectiveness, since the achievement of the outcomes was dependent on the successful implementation of the regional network. Although ICT has dramatically expanded its reach in all SASEC countries (para. 47 and Appendix 1), these changes happened before the regional network component was completed and functional (albeit 42 World Bank, Data Source: World Development Indicators for South Asia. momentarily) in late 2017. Nevertheless, the project saw some positive developments in individual countries, especially in Bhutan, which has expanded the reach of CECs to 210 communities, making the services available on the internet more accessible to the country’s rural and remote areas. The country has also strategically leveraged the regional network infrastructure within the country to establish the DrukREN network."
1,"The project’s social development officer, who was tasked with overseeing and reporting on GAP implementation from the central project management unit (PMU), had no gender expertise, so the project missed a critical opportunity to achieve gender targets (e.g., in developing an agricultural curriculum guide to include gender-related contents, or in planning extension programs that included gender-related activities)."
1,Timing of the project performance evaluation report. The project performance evaluation report may be prepared in 2021 or later.
0,"Through implementation of GAP activities by SME DNC, women start-ups were able to increase their knowledge, receive guidance on how to operate a business. They were also given opportunities for networking and exchange of ideas and learning positive examples of other women in business. Other strategic benefits for women brought by program are:"
0,"The project was classified as category B for environment at appraisal. Initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for each subproject by the government, and the project was not expected to cause significant environmental problems and the likely adverse impacts were manageable. According to national classifications, the project was categorized as “low risk environmental impact"". Mitigation measures set out in an IEE report were compiled during construction. The environmental management plan (EMP) included the relevant mitigation measures proposed in the IEE for identified site-specific environmental impacts."
0,"The program was conceived in the context of ADB’s country strategy for Pakistan prepared in 2003, which proposed re-engagement in the water sector through province-focused projects on conservation, drought mitigation, rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure, and strengthening of institutional capacities through coordinated assistance with the World Bank for policy and water sector reforms.5 The project appraisal context in 2006 was (i) reforms progress after Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority Act was passed in July 1997; (ii) lessons drawn from the National Drainage Project funded by ADB, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the World Bank; (iii) Punjab medium-term irrigation reform program in 2006, supported by the World Bank, and (iv) Punjab Irrigation Department priority projects for the rehabilitation of vital hydraulic structures (footnote 3).6 At appraisal, the government was effectively coordinating and leading the support of development partners around a common reform agenda and development investments. ADB financed a team of consultants to prepare a comprehensive sector assessment, the MFF, and project design.7 The design required long-term investments with sector reforms and continued government engagement for transformative changes in water service delivery. The MFF modality was the right financing instrument to select."
1,"Water Supply Subprojects: Methodology and the calculation model including assumptions followed in the processing stage for the estimation of water supply benefits were retained, as there is no change in the beneficiary profile and quantum. The subprojects are for the rehabilitation of existing water supply system including the water source augmentation, house service connections and district metered area-based supply network in order to achieve 100% coverage with 200 liter per capita per day (lpcd) in Nakchivan and Goychay, 180 lpcd in Agdash and Beylegan and 150 lpcd in Aghjabedi (the existing coverage is 80% with 101 lpcd in Nakchivan; the existing coverage is 59.6%% with 90 lpcd in Goychay; the existing coverage is 31.1% with 19 lpcd in Agdash 35% coverage with 13 lpcd in Beylegan and 32% coverage with 16 lpcd in Aghjabedi). The beneficiaries will be 265,314 persons (about 57,000 households) by 2018. Present water consumption is 150 lpcd in Nakchivan, 90 lpcd in Goychay, 100 lpcd in Agdash. 100 lpcd in Beylagan and 60 lpcd in Aghjabedi of which 13 – 101 lpcd are provided from piped water.

0,"However, the project did not engage with the systemic issues surrounding the funding of O&M, and as with similar ADB investments in rural physical infrastructure assets, the longer- term sustainability of benefits will ultimately depend on both the availability of funding from provincial budgets, which in turn depends on the resources available and degree of their prioritization, and on communities’ ability to manage the assets. Discussions with farmers also suggest some may not be able to sustain the rice productivity increases reported to date without continued input subsidies and/or training. Beneficiaries made numerous requests to the project completion reporting mission for more training to support the agriculture extension and livestock activities already initiated. This indicates that, although the project met the DMF output performance targets for training, technical absorption and adoption of activities may have been lower than anticipated. Similarly, although the hygiene aspect of livelihoods training was readily adopted by target beneficiaries—especially women—and is likely to be sustained through continuing informal transfer, livestock-related livelihood activities have gained less  traction. Many households disposed of project-supplied pigs or chickens after one or two breeding cycles, and in other cases, the animals died soon after delivery."

0,"The performance of the contractor, COVEC (China) Ltd, was less than satisfactory. According to the DOW, the contractor was slow to mobilize and did not bring proper equipment or qualified staff to the site. The contractor also did not take advantage of fair weather to hasten progress. The contractor was not forthcoming in following the engineer’s instructions. Delays by the contractor in submitting field data for design changes and evaluating contract variation proposals and other planning documents led to a poor working relationship with the construction supervision consultant. COVEC (China) Ltd generally lacked resource-planning capacity, and experienced time overruns. COVEC (China) Ltd’s performance subsequently improved, thanks to close supervision from the DOW. Once these concerns were overcome, the contractor was able to prove that lead foreign contractors can effectively construct and repair roads in the highlands."

The project developed and employed targeting approaches and specific criteria for identifying and targeting beneficiaries among the ID poor 1 and 2 or the commune poverty list by the provincial authorities for each project activity to ensure vulnerable households were prioritized, reached, and benefited from all the activities. Based on the selection criteria, initial beneficiary identification was done (i) by the village heads with commune councils for free rice distribution, (ii) by the project committees in collaboration with commune councils through open village meetings (OVMs) for CFW and FFW; by the village heads with commune councils through OVMs for seeds and fertilizer distribution; and (iii) by Local Management Committee (consisting of teachers, village heads, and commune councils) for school scholarships. After the identification/OVMs for food/quality inputs distribution, hotlines both at the Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) and CARM and a list of selected beneficiaries were provided at the commune council bulletin boards for complaints (if any). Identified beneficiary lists were endorsed by the implementing agencies at the national and provincial level and by the CPMU at the EA. Independent monitors (NGOs) were engaged to oversee monitoring of beneficiary identification, distribution and complaint resolution process of food and quality inputs distribution activities. This three-tier approach in beneficiary targeting  was effective in increasing transparency and engendering trust between the grassroots level  and RGC.

The project was also designed to contribute to national water resources management by providing support to the WRU to expand its training capacity."
1,"Implementation delays and cost overruns. The project implementation was marked by cost overruns and implementation delays. The detailed design estimated the cost of all contracts at 12.8% higher than at appraisal. During implementation, the actual cost for the civil works rose by about 32.9% more than the contract price, mainly because of price escalation and additional works. Civil works contract periods were set at 32 months regardless of the contract value, location, and site conditions (topographical and geotechnical). A key learning for future road projects in Bhutan is that the contract duration should consider rock excavation quantities, steepness of terrain, whether the civil works are greenfields or brownfields, and impacts of the monsoon season."
0,"The total treatment costs for each case type was known and an average cost per case was derived from this. To figure out the impact of “with CP” on total costs, the case mix was held constant and rebased to the “with CP” case mix. Further, to control for hospitals shifting more complex (and more expensive) cases from the CP program to regular treatment regimes, the effects of changes in per unit pricing (i.e., rate-related) were isolated from changes due to length of stay (i.e., volume-related). The result is that total costs “with CP” were 33% lower than “without CP”; about 70% was rate-related and 30% was volume-related. As such, overall, the lower average length of stay from the CP program reduced costs by about 10%; the results were more pronounced for case types with decreased ALOS (Table A15.7).

1,"Additional assistance. While ADB and Azerbaijan’s other development partners noted that macroeconomic management during this challenging period was adequate, they considered that several critical structural, regulatory, and public sector reforms needed to be carried out to sustain the restored trajectory of economic growth. The GOA led that recognition in many ways and initiated a wide range of structural and institutional reforms since then. A sub-set of these reforms have been designed and implemented with ADB under the ongoing IGPSE. But the GOA’s reform agenda goes well beyond the scope of ADB’s current programmatic assistance. ADB is well positioned to lead key coordination processed among the development partners in further supporting the envisaged reforms through effective and tailor-made TA. All stakeholders need to make a collective and continued effort to steer the reforms aimed at economic diversification and private sector-led development. The structural reforms that Azerbaijan has embarked upon need to be fully implemented to produce results, and capacity constraints are significant in many fronts. The critical reforms include rule-based fiscal budgeting and the adoption of a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) and Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), along with other important reforms like implementation of the SOE reforms action plan and implementation of the newly enacted corporate governance rules for SOEs."

The PMU, for the executing agency, opened the national sub-accounts and 12 PIU sub-accounts in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and MOF. The expenditures of the national institutions as implementing agencies were managed by the PMU. MOH provided an initial advance from the national sub-accounts to each provincial sub- accounts, or alternatively, requested MOF to provide funds directly from the advance account. The PIUs submitted fund transfer requests for the replenishment of their project accounts. At project completion, disbursements totaled $11.99 million under the project and $2.93 million under additional financing."
0,"The scope of the project interventions was appropriate in targeting these groups. Supporting both the consumption and production dimensions of livelihoods, and linking this to wider capacity development, was necessary to address food security issues in a holistic manner. The geographic focus of the project on seven provinces around the Tonle Sap Basin, plus three extremely vulnerable slum communities in Phnom Penh—Beungkok, Stung Meanchey, and Riverside—was justified by the high incidence of poverty in these areas,11 ongoing and future ADB investments, and the fragility of the local ecosystem. The design and monitoring frameworks (DMFs) for the project and additional financing were clearly specified."
0,"The project design also included the formation and financing of 12 irrigation management units (IMUs) in the LBDC command area to provide the technical interface on behalf of farmer organizations with the area water board and to support farmer organizations in O&M, engineering guidance, groundwater, conjunctive use, on-farm water management strategies, monitoring, agricultural services, and administration and financial management, including billing and record keeping for abiana. The institutional structure of the arrangement at appraisal changed from project-financed IMUs to the PIDA, the PID, and the project management unit (PMU) during implementation for three key reasons. Firstly, under the PIDA’s revised rules in 2010, services provided by the PID staff were made available to the chief executive of the area water board to support the farmer organizations. Secondly, this change was in line with devolved systems in canal command areas elsewhere in Punjab. Lastly, until farmer organizations become self- sustaining, government support was considered essential. Newly formed farmer organizations were grouped in 19 irrigation management transfer units supported by the government and as such, staffing and financing of IMUs were excluded from the project design."

Therefore, it faced some challenges in mobilizing women to participate in project activities such as workshops on extension needs."
1,"The long gestation period from the signing of the subloan agreement until a private vocational college is able to access the loan is also due to changes in Viet Nam’s construction law. Under the new Viet Nam Law on Construction, an investor is required to submit a subproject feasibility study and working drawings before a construction permit could be approved. This affected one vocational college that had secured a construction permit before the issuance of the new law but had to secure another permit. There is no indication of cost overruns, technical difficulties or procurement issues during subproject implementation."

This excludes possible sustained benefits years after the end of the project. As at appraisal, a 12% discount rate was used in line with the first project analysis. With a total cost of $74 million over 5 years, the project’s economic net present value is estimated at around $21 million (high for Viet Nam, and negative for both Cambodia and the Lao PDR) and EIRR at 21%, both lower than at appraisal ($27 million and 28%).4 These underestimate the total economic benefits from the project.

At appraisal, benefits were estimated using projected income and population-projected DALYs based on 2004 WHO data. In addition to using recent data, unlike at appraisal, DALYs in the project sites are assumed to be lower than national estimates by around 10%. 3 At appraisal, annual GDP is estimated assuming a 5% GDP growth across the 3 countries.

0,"The facility and project 6 benefitted from several new state of the art systems that contributed to ADB’s corporate results framework (Appendixes 16 and 17). These included more efficient designs of new power distribution lines through the application of GPS technology and tapping of new lines and connections to the nearest point, and the computerization of all operations, which streamlined the storage and delivery of spare parts and reduced power outage and repair time. Computerization also enabled the full use of enterprise resources planning software, which greatly enhanced the MPPMCL’s ability to forecast and balance power demands and maintain the same tariffs for the 3 DISCOMs, though delivery costs vary. The industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic consumers’ electrical equipment is operating more efficiently due to the proper voltage and reduced surges resulting in savings in power cost and equipment maintenance and replacement. A major benefit for the rural economy is that all electrical equipment and irrigation pumps will now have a substantially longer operational life.36 The improved power supply has contributed to increased economic activity. The implementation of the facility has strengthened the institutional capacity of the DISCOMs and the managerial and operational competence of their managers and staff. The economic viability of the works provided under the facility has been confirmed through a better than projected EIRR, and the financial sustainability has also been confirmed with an FIRR well above the WACC, though lower than estimated at appraisal. The projected direct benefits of both the facility and project 6 have been realized fully, as detailed in the FFA (Appendix 1), and these will be maintained in the longer-term life of the facilities improved under the MFF."
1,"In Viet Nam, a national gender and safeguard consultant was engaged to develop the project EGP from February 2012 to July 2013. Some EGP activities were implemented by the PPMUs in 16 border provinces with high density of ethnic minority people (e.g., translating IEC materials in Khmer language for ethnic groups in Tay Ninh Province). Training sessions for the health staff and VHWs from ethnic group backgrounds were the main benefits of the projects. However, the central PMU was not able to provide data to confirm achievements on certain activities and targets—most importantly, the inclusion of ethnic group issues in project planning and management meetings, and the implementation of ethnic disaggregated data for S&R in all forms and reporting documents. With 8 indicators achieved, 4 indicators partly achieved, and 5 with unknown results because of unavailable data, it was concluded that the EGP implementation in Viet Nam was less than satisfactory. More strategic planning and close monitoring is required for future projects in which ethnic groups are targeted as project beneficiaries. EGP achievements are detailed in Appendix 9."

An appropriated percentage of female teachers have been promoted in capacity building activities in order to build professional skills and leadership skills. A separate training on gender mainstreaming was also conducted to build awareness of gender equality. After training, all trained vocational colleges were required to develop their own gender action plan to address gender issues and promote the enrolment of female students in the non-traditional subjects and occupations. Tran Thi Tuyet Dong was born in 1970. After finishing high school, Mrs. Dong got married and soon had two children (her older son was born in 1990 and younger daughter was born in 1995). Her husband’s income as a ranger in the district was not enough to support four persons in her family. In 1999, when her children were grown-up, Dong deliberated with her husband and set about doing a driving apprenticeship in Yen Bai Provincial Electromechanical School. She eventually qualified for a Driver’s License Class C, as truck driver – an occupation often said to be only for men. After leaving the School, Dong worked as a taxi driver in Yen Bai City. Once she saw an advertisement on the provincial television, that Yen Bai Vocational College was recruiting teachers for a driving course. Dong liked this very much, but she knew that she was just a driver without pedagogical skills, and it would be hard to become a driving instructor. So, Dong went to Vinh Phuc city to enroll in a pedagogical course for three months. Afterwards, Dong was recruited as a practical driving instructor by Yen Bai Vocational College, Transport Department, now its Driving Training Center. Dong said, “Originally, the occupation of driver and driving instructor was deemed to be not for women who had weak legs and soft hands.” Thus, after being recruited, she still was not trusted by the school officials. Initially, she underwent probation, became a teaching assistant, office worker, etc. But whatever was assigned, she was not afraid of difficulties. She always tried to learn to complete her tasks with burning passion, sitting inside a car and teaching trainees how to drive a car on the roads. Eventually, she was trusted by everyone and assigned to guide trainees to practice driving. She said, “I am very happy to do the work with my passion, and I can do well all the work involved as a driver.” She recalled that once, she and her trainees were driving on the road and their car suddenly broken down. She got under the vehicle to inspect the engine, grease the pump and change tires. The headmaster went through, looking at her dirty face and asked, “Are you in charge of the car? I admire you for that.”"

Similarly, commercial rice seed sold by AQIP, was also produced through some of the same farmer associations, in addition to other groups not directly associated with the project. This directly benefitted the seed-producing farmers, who were able to recoup an additional 250 to 300 KR/kg ($0.06 to $0.08/kg) over the standard price for paddy on the market. Additionally, excess rice seed produced by the farmer associations was sold on the open market benefiting the farmers with prices of KR700/kg ($0.18/kg) above the price of paddy in the market. 2 They are (i) Centre d'Etude et de Developpement Agricole Cambodgien (CEDAC); (ii) Crossroads to Development; and (iii) Buddhism for Development.

1,"Preparation to approval of subprojects—All 3 private vocational colleges did not have previous experience with ADB-supported projects, which partly explains the delays in subproject preparation. A vocational college had to redo its subproject proposal 5 to 6 times. The VDB has a manual that guides its staff in provincial branches in loan appraisal. The procedure requires having to go back to previous steps after a vocational college makes a revision or adjustment. This circuitous process prolonged the preparation and approval process. In September 2013 and on the request of one vocational college, the process was shortened by allowing VDB head office to undertake the appraisal. But even with that favorable response from the VDB, it still took at least 8 months from appraisal did the vocational college receive a notice of loan approval."

0,"The investment program is rated inefficient because only one tranche was delivered out of the planned four tranches in 15 years of MFF availability. The PFR1 is rated less than efficient as the intended outputs and outcome were not fully achieved within the loan budget. Loan allocation to prepare the follow-up PFR was not timely allocated, and the project was extended for 23 months. Project start-up delays along with long procurement and resettlement processes necessitated the extension. The total loan and grant disbursement reached 84% and 93%, respectively. The economic internal rate of return declined slightly compared to appraisal (27.8%), but remained high (23.7%) at completion. The economic internal rate of return at appraisal was based on estimated benefits due to (i) potential increase in water supply to domestic, municipal and industrial users; and (ii) increased in paddy cultivation productivity. The project completion report analysis considers the same sources of benefits yields, but updates all relevant parameters on costs, water supply forecasts, cropping intensity, and per-hectare farm income of paddy and maize.

The executing agency and ADB made the right decision in combining the Balloki Barrage works into one contract, New Khanki Barrage into one contract, and the LBDC works into three packages. The Pakpattan Canal and LBDC distribution system packages were, however, large and appeared unmanageable due to the geographic spread, canal operational flow constraints, and short construction period. PID’s divisional staff from Balloki, Khanewal, Okara, and Sahiwal were not part of the implementation as per the design (project 1). This kept project implementation and canals operations disjointed.

0,"Project startup under Loan A was delayed, requiring 15 months from loan effectiveness (14 February 2011) to mobilization of implementation consultants (1 May 2012). The delay was because of the state treasury’s initial rejection of the remuneration rate for national consultants, which was deemed too high. The issue was resolved only after the intervention of the Ministry of Planning and Investment and the MTR mission. This delay resulted in the withdrawal of many international consultants initially tapped to develop the skills standards in the identified key occupations and help vocational colleges develop their equipment lists. Finding replacements caused further delays. Updating and harmonizing equipment lists among the vocational colleges also took time. Given its limited staff—and their lack of experience in managing ODA projects— the PMU initially had difficulties following ADB loan disbursement procedures and assessing the equipment packages. This further contributed to slow project start-up. Problems were later addressed by expanding the PMU’s technical unit to better support procurement. ADB also provided more training and guidance to the PMU on project financial management. The closing date for Loan A was extended from 29 February 2016 to 31 August 2017 to procure additional equipment using savings, following the increased acceleration of project implementation post- MTR, and positive feedback from the vocational colleges on the initial equipment procurement. Financial closing of Loan A was only possible on 30 April 2018 due to delayed submission of the final withdrawal application. The refund of unused imprest advance was received on 12 March 2018."

However, the external monitoring consultant reported no complaint was lodged to high levels because all complaints received were solved at commune or district level. Most of the complaints were related to land ownership verification, errors in DMS process, missing entitlements, and impacts that emerged during the construction period. There were some complaints due to houses cracking and delayed compensation. The CARCs, in cooperation with the CPMU, PPMUs, WRU-PMU, local authorities, and affected households, reviewed and solved the complaints on a case-by-case basis. By the time of the PCR mission, there were no pending issues."
0,"The project sub-zone approach demonstrated the development impact that could be achieved with focused investment and support services, and with a functioning regulatory environment that monitored illegal connections, and achieved an increase in service, in billing collections, and revenues. Unfortunately, by the end of the project, the institutional capacity, the regulatory change, the financing, and the commitment to complete the investment in other sub- zones and across the Dili water supply system were not in place. By project close, some of the project outputs and outcomes were already in decline, and this has continued, as noted by the PCR team. The potential development impact will not be achieved, as there was a negligible change in NRW losses across the system. The impact on the benefits to women was not measured, though it is expected to be limited given the project outcomes. The development impact is rated unsatisfactory."
0,"Facility. The facility is considered likely sustainable. The aggregate financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the overall MFF is estimated at 15.9% (on a weighted average basis), compared to an overall (average) FIRR of 10.5% as  appraised (Appendix 15). The overall  FIRR for the MFF exceeds the reevaluated WACC (2.0%), indicating an expectation of a solid financial return on the investment. Additionally, the DISCOMs financial performance and position has improved as a consequence of the facility, with electricity sales up by 200% (in terms of units sold) and almost 250% (in revenue terms) since appraisal. Additionally, accounting losses fell by over ₹10,000 million between FY2014 and FY2016 and the composite assets of the entities have increased around 200% since appraisal."
1,"Covenants. The MFF had 91 loan covenants. The 27 covenants for tranche 1 are generally relevant to the project, although they could be reduced in number. Tranche 2 had 64 covenants (Appendix 7). Some covenants pertaining to the project agreement appear to be generic to a physical infrastructure project and have not been developed specifically for tranche 2. The number of covenants for any project should be rationalized and only include those that are relevant and specific to the project (para.45)."
0,"Based on ADB and executing agency progress reports, the overall performance of the consultants is rated less than satisfactory. Consultant due diligence was inadequate and the PPRRs for projects 1 and 2 revealed weak supervision and contract management. A total of 1,266 person-months (362 international and 904 national) of consulting services from consulting firms were planned for and financed from the ADB loans. These services were required for implementation support, capacity development, and socioeconomic monitoring. Key tasks included (i) design of road improvement works; (ii) preparation of bid documents, procurement support, and supervision of road improvement works and long-term maintenance contracts; (iii) performance monitoring; (iv) preparation of subsequent projects; (v) capacity development; and (vi) socioeconomic monitoring. The government’s lengthy approval process delayed the recruitment of the implementation support and capacity development consultants. No major issues arose concerning the performance of consultants. However, international staff could have been better integrated with local staff, preferably in an advisory role (as they were in previous ADB projects)."
1,"Tariff and institutional reform. The project was implemented during the transition period from government-dominated wastewater investment to ongoing market-oriented wastewater sector reform at the county level. BMG should examine WWTPs in terms of operation efficiency, tariff increases, and corporate structure and governance, to gradually achieve full cost recovery in county WWTP operations and turn them into fully autonomous entities."
0,Several factors were critical to the successful achievement of GAP targets:
0,"UCSA and the PCU had previously implemented WSS projects financed by ADB and other development partners, and their capability to manage projects financed by international financial institutions was generally effective. Although the PCU maintained good coordination among ADB, contractors, and consultants, it failed to produce quarterly project progress reports using the PPMS approved by ADB. The PMCs mainly prepared quarterly progress reports and submitted them to ADB only upon request."
0,"Compensation was paid to affected households for the loss of land, structures, and trees in accordance with ADB’s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and the Royal Government of Bhutan’s Land Act 1979 (amended in 2007). During implementation, a total of 438 affected persons were given the options of land replacement or cash compensations for the loss of land, or a combination of both. Despite the higher number of actual affected persons, the disbursed amount for compensation was lower than the budget estimate at Nu37,371,106.56 because many (170 households) opted for land replacement in the same dungkhag (subdistrict). The project provided 108.99 acres of replacement land and compensated or rehabilitated community structures as outlined in the resettlement plans. A total of Nu940,536 ($13,845) was paid to service and utility providers (e.g., Bhutan Telecom and Bhutan Power Cooperation Limited). In addition, the project reconstructed important community structures such as temples, irrigation channels, and prayer wheels. Overall, the project disbursed Nu38,671,642 ($569,247) in compensation for households and community structures."
1,"More efficient arrangement on project completion reports under multitranche financing facility. ADB should consider allowing the facility completion report to include all tranches, especially if such tranches financed major network infrastructure investments in the same locations and the concerned tranches were completed at the same time or within a short time span from each other."
1,"Active consultation. The policy reform agenda benefited from active consultation within ADB’s divisions, incorporating lessons from previous ADB-funded reform programs, and recognizing issues identified in the preparation of new projects, ensuring that the reforms were responsive to Pakistan’s needs and implementable given the fiscal and institutional constraints."
1,Covenants. The covenants in the loan and project agreements should be maintained in their existing form until 2020.
0,"Productivity enhancement support. Seed and fertilizer were to be sold to smallholders and marginal farmers at subsidized prices. Activities included (a) identification of target farmers; (b) procurement, transport, and storage of seed and fertilizer; and (c) sale of seed and fertilizer to target beneficiaries. Seed and fertilizer recipients would be provided with extension services, to be combined (where feasible) with supplementary irrigation enhanced by field channels and subsidiary canals rehabilitated under the FFW program."
1,Covenants. It is recommended that the covenants in the loan and project agreements for operation of project facilities be maintained in their existing form during operation.23
1,"In situations where the executing agency is unfamiliar with the project delivery approach  planned at appraisal, such as the use of turnkey contracts, it would be helpful to provide  implementation support through a consultant. The FMC was appointed almost 1.5 years after  project approval and lasted for 1 year only due to poor performance. A new firm was hired 1.5  year after termination of the previous FMC. The absence of consultants delayed finalization of  engineering design for turnkey subprojects and completion of related safeguards documentation  in previous tranches. Had experienced support been available sooner, the time required to put  turnkey projects in place may have been reduced."
0,"The program is rated likely sustainable. PID has 7 decades of experience in irrigation systems, including barrages, irrigation canals, and distribution systems. PID determines the maintenance and repair (M&R) requirements using criteria based on established asset parameters. Costs are revised based on market prices. Since 2007, the estimated M&R cost increased from PRs 2.3 billion to PRs 9.2 billion. The M&R budget allocation was increased with a cumulative allocation of PRs64 billion from FY2007 to FY2018. This equates nearly to the yearly estimated requirements with likely increase in flooding years for flood protection, strengthening, and repair. During the same period (FY2007–FY2018), PID operational budget (including nearly 40,000 staff) increased from PRs 4 billion to PRs 9.5 billion. PID utilized about 95% of the allocated budget for operations and maintenance."
0,"The project is rated likely sustainable by considering the institutional and financial arrangements for road construction and maintenance, fast growing traffic, improved road safety management capacity, and ADB’s continued financial and technical support to state road development in Madhya Pradesh."
0,"The Government of PNG formed a program steering committee (PSC) to oversee project implementation, monitor progress, approve roads for subsequent tranches, and provide guidance to the executing agency and implementing agencies. The PSC was to meet at least quarterly and to be chaired by the Secretary of the DOW or a named designee. Other members of the PSC were to include the chief executive officer of the NRA; the executive director of the NRSC; senior officials of the Department of National Planning & Monitoring, the Department of Treasury, and the Department of Finance; the valuer general of the Department of Lands & Physical Planning; a representative of the Department of Environment and Conservation; provincial administrators from the five highlands provinces; and representatives of relevant police forces and chambers of commerce. The PSC met 12 times during the project 1 implementation period. This equates to about 37% of the required meetings over the 8-year active life of the project, as stipulated under loan covenant LA 2496, Schedule 5, Para. 1."
0,"The improvements in budgetary allocation and estimation, and infrastructure upgrade projects were a result of an asset management plan for gradually reducing the deferred maintenance backlog. The PID has adopted a third party for monitoring and evaluation of maintenance and repair works with spot-checking of sample works. The overall system has improved in regard to the changing maintenance demand, and it is likely that the government will continue to provide funds. For barrages, the PID operations manual provides comprehensive guidance on O&M. The project has improved technical sustainability, and enhanced and sustained water diversions and conveyance capacity, reducing maintenance requirements in the short to medium-term. Since the 1997 reforms, five area water boards, comprising about 400 farmer organizations elected by more than 19,000 khal panchayats and administering 1,000 channels, were established in Punjab while the rest of the canal command remained as a conventional PID-administered system. The LBDC command area operation is still largely dependent on the PID operational cost of PRs 254 million, 1,250 staff, and a maintenance budget estimated at PRs 509 million as per the approved yardstick, in addition to the operational expenses of the PIDA, the area water board, and the farmer organizations.25"
1,"In comparison to the economic analysis results for the combined water supply and wastewater subprojects during the loan processing stage (2009/2011/2013), the EIRR have reduced at this PCR stage for four project towns, except Aghijabedi. This reduction in viability results can be assigned to the following reasons, as indicated in Table A10.10. Major devaluation of the local currency in 2015 and its conversion to US$ will not reflect the cost overrun impact correctly and hence not appropriate to consider cost overrun in the efficiency analysis. Among the towns, the performance of SAWMC managed Nakchivan town was found to be better in terms of higher EIRR and without time overrun for network contracts."
0,"The procurement of goods and services followed ADB’s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Annual and cumulative contract awards are shown in Appendix 6 while the list of goods and services procured are in Appendix 7. Packages for Loan A covered implementation support for both Loans A and B in addition to investment activities under Loan A. Procurement under Loan B meant for onlending activities was done directly by private vocational colleges following Viet Nam Procurement Law. For Loan A, prior review was used for all packages while for Loan B, post review was undertaken. As agreed during the midterm review, the VDB submitted the procurement documents, in Vietnamese, to both ADB and the Viet Nam Resident Mission, and the resident mission procurement officer reviewed the documents for ADB.22"
1,"Timing of the project performance evaluation report. The project performance evaluation report should be prepared in the second half of 2019. By then the project road will have been in operation for about 2 years and the border post will have been opened for about 1 year. This time frame will allow the evaluation team to realistically assess traffic volume on the project road, road conditions, maintenance requirements, and socioeconomic benefits and impacts in the project area."

Three water treatment and supply systems connecting to rehabilitated water bodies to supply water to 3 communities in two provinces were installed. Community Dissemination and Training Centers were constructed and equipped with chairs, whiteboards, etc. in 99 out of the 100 target communes, in order to create facilities at community level for conducting meetings/workshops (to promote debate and discussion regarding delivery of inputs, for example), for training (knowledge transfer/awareness raising), for dissemination of information and ideas, for spaces for conflict resolutions, for community products displays and fairs, and for any other community social activities, etc."

0,"During the preparation of the MFF and appraisal of the first two projects, it was confirmed that TRANSCO and the DISCOMs had the required technical design, procurement, construction management, financial, institutional, and administrative capacity to implement the facility through the individual projects. A project implementation consultant was not required due in part to the design of the ICB packages, which did not involve detailed designs but rather required the contractors to complete detailed surveys and equipment testing and adjust the designs based on the actual conditions of the existing systems. The DISCOMs had experienced in-house engineers reviewing the ICB contractors’ scope changes and providing construction oversight. TRANSCO and the DISCOMs recruited independent safeguard consultants for the preparation of social and environmental management plans and related monitoring and reporting. However, for the initial two projects, the monitoring and reporting of safeguards aspects were weak and did not meet ADB requirements. This was corrected in 2010 when a safeguards’ review mission from ADB provided clear guidance and instructions for incorporation of these in the works contracts, detailed monitoring, and regular reporting. The DISCOMs also recruited the services of third-party inspectors to conduct technical monitoring and testing of project equipment and materials. The third-party inspectors checked specifications at the factory level and conducted testing of completed equipment prior to shipment. The equipment specifications were checked again upon delivery to the project sites and the operational efficiencies of the equipment were tested after installation and before the new systems were connected to the grid. The DISCOMs funded these consultants."
1,"Investment costs. The investment costs consist primarily of a project loan from ADB in the amount of $49.2 million. Of the total, $1 million was disbursed in 2011, $0.5 million in 2012, $0.8 million in 2013, $7.6 million in 2014, $19.9 million in 2015, $6.7 million in 2016 and the remaining $13 million in 2017. The project loan was used to upgrade equipment in 15 selected public vocational colleges and to build new training facilities in 3 private vocational colleges. The investment cost is expected to have a total economic value of $44.3 million from 2011 to 2039."
1,"Cost estimation. To avoid significant cost underruns in future projects, it is recommended ADB due diligence build on the executing agencies completed pre-feasibly study and refer to market rates for similar investments in the country."
1,"Gender and ethnic group action plan. Some of the gender targets set at appraisal were revised during the project midterm review, as the original targets were based on available information at that time. Adequate investment needs to be made as part of due diligence to ensure sex-disaggregated baseline data and gender related information, including information on the actual constraints faced by women to equally benefit from the project interventions. Close monitoring of the gender and ethnic group action plan implementation, with support from gender and social development expertise, is necessary for identifying challenges and strategies to address the issues and making necessary adjustments in a timely manner during project implementation. Understanding of the cultural sensitivity with regard to disclosure of ethnic origins should have been incorporated when the targets were set at the time of appraisal and adjusted during the project midterm review."
0,"Project 1 planned completion was September 2013. It was extended first to 30 September 2015 and later extended a further three times to 30 September 2017 up to the MFF terminal date. Delays occurred throughout the entire project cycle. Initial delays were attributed to insufficient project readiness at approval, which prompted longer preparatory work for consultant recruitment, project design, and procurement. Civil works at the Balloki Barrage took longer than expected and the slow construction progress during implementation delayed completion further. Implementation was also delayed by the need to complete studies and detailed designs for additional sub-projects under the facility. Loan accounts were closed for all loans well within the 4-month winding up period. Project 2 implementation period at appraisal was 4.5 years. Contract award was delayed by about 1 year. The original loan closing date was extended twice - by 9 months in total, to cover the backlog of work caused by the initial delay. Project 3 implementation period at appraisal was 4 years. The loan was extended by six months to complete remaining civil works. A comparison of projects’ schedules at appraisal and actual is provided in Appendix 5."
1,"Building on the successful implementation of REMDP, the following recommendations are made to include in similar projects: (i) assessment of impacts and land acquisition requirements, and meaningful consultations with all stakeholders early on; (ii) a carefully designed livelihood restoration program, with specific activities targeting the specific beneficiaries and ensuring access to job opportunities; and (iii) inclusion of wealth management coaching and assistance as part of the income restoration activities to ensure that the affected households manage their compensation income appropriately to secure the continuation of their livelihood income. Since stabilization of livelihoods for affected people takes several years, it is prudent to conduct a survey after 4-5 years after resettlement to supplement the survey done in 2017."

0,"The implementation of the civil works contract for the three sub-zones (Ensul; footnote 09) was delayed due to initial issues with the contractor’s bank guarantee, delays with material deliveries, and the contractor lacking the adequate equipment to complete the contract on time. Given these delays, it was recognized that Ensul would not be able to complete all works. Options were considered to complete the works, including Ensul using a subcontractor. The DNSA, MPW, and ADB decided that funds (of approximately $700,000) be re-allocated under the existing contract and that Ensul would subcontract the works to a national contractor with an established record in the water sector to install these works. The works covered bore wells and pumps, 160 household connections, and some piping. While Ensul’s work was completed late (in July 2013), it was of good quality."

They were fully in line with the government’s development strategy and ADB’s sector policy. The transmission and distribution works under the facility  were  completed  with  minor changes. The implementation of modern financial management at TRANSCO, DISCOMs, and MPPMCL helped achieve increased revenues. These, among others, have contributed to the achievement of outcomes. The EIRR for both the facility and project are greater than the 12% hurdle rate. Similarly, the FIRR was higher than the WACC.40"

0,"The project remained relevant at completion, given its continued alignment with government policy and ADB priorities. It is consistent with the government’s announcement in 2017 that all public technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions should become autonomous.27 The project enabled the public vocational colleges to attract private enterprises, increase enrolments, raise tuition, and generate revenues by upgrading their training equipment and upskilling their managers and teachers. It also remained consistent with ADB’s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016–2020,28 which aims to support formal technical and vocational education that is linked with labor market demands. The project is also aligned with Strategy 202029 under which ADB will increasingly direct its attention to raising the quality of TVET. However, for Loan B, the demand from the private colleges was minimal given the initially high interest rates. This also caused a delay in project implementation. Although the higher interest rates—resulting from the global financial crisis in 2009—were not anticipated at the time of project design, with consultations and earlier involvement of the VDB, the credit and exchange risk could have been eliminated. The modality of project lending for Loan A was still appropriate at completion. For Loan B, direct lending to the private vocational colleges could have been a possibility, which would have avoided some of the problems encountered by the project. However, in that case, the colleges would have had to absorb all the credit and exchange rate risks and it is unclear how much demand there would have been for the loan. The project’s DMF was for the most part appropriate while some performance targets, such as on gender, were unrealistic. 27 The government is finalizing a decree on “Autonomy Mechanism for Public TVET Institutes”, but Resolution No. 19- NQ/TW already stated an aim of “10% of TVET institutes able to achieve financial autonomy by 2021”."

0,"At both appraisal and completion, the project was rated relevant, as it was an integral part of government strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction. The project supported government development plans at appraisal—and their later updates—on developing a network of high-capacity, high-speed expressways to support fast socioeconomic development. The government's Expressway Master Plan included the project expressway in the short-term program of priority expressway projects. 28 The project was also in line with ADB’s country partnership strategy (CPS) priorities for Viet Nam (CPS, 2007–2010). At completion, the project remained aligned with the CPS, 2016–2020 in (i) promoting job creation and competitiveness, (ii) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery, and (iii) improving environmental sustainability and climate change response. The project was highly consistent with ADB’s strategy for the road sector in Viet Nam. ADB’s cumulative lending, grant, and TA commitments to Viet Nam up to the end of 2017 reached $15.8 billion, with 34.96% going to the transport sector."
0,"Some 123,923 participants (60% of them women) received poverty-focused environment and technology training. Commune offices received hardware, such as shelters, computers, and solar power. Of 401 self-help groups (SHGs) that received capacity-building support, 42 were transformed into agriculture cooperatives; and 152 community projects, such as ponds, tube wells, afforestation, and school shading, were implemented. Hardware and training on M&E, database management, and other skills were provided to strengthen food security monitoring. The capacity of subnational planners and ministry staff was strengthened to improve coordination of national planning for food security and nutrition."

0,"Physical outputs were fully achieved as planned. The project slightly exceeded its targets on WSS infrastructure through the expansion of water trunk mains from 152.6 km to 153.9 km, and water distribution networks from 233.0 km to 243.3 km. With large physical improvements, the project vodokanals’ water treatment and distribution capacities substantially increased. The system leakage in project vodokanals was reduced to less than 30% in Andijan, Karakalpakstan, and Khorezm subprojects.29 However, it remains at 35% in Djizzak subproject due to the old and physically deteriorated distribution networks which were not supported by this project. Water quality has improved significantly and is compliant with national drinking water standards. The project contributed to adequate sewage collection for Andijan city through the rehabilitation of its existing sewerage networks and the expansion of its sewage collection capacity from the appraisal target of 10.4 km to 11.9 km."
0,"The program remained relevant with the sector priorities of ADB and the government until completion. ADB Strategy 2020 refocused on the key core area of infrastructure development, including water resources management and the delivery of efficient and sustainable irrigation.8 The program remained central to ADB’s country partnership strategy, 2009–2013 and 2015– 2019, which supported investments in the rehabilitation, upgrade, and expansion of the Indus Basin irrigation system with irrigation and water resources reform initiatives.9 The Government of Punjab’s Medium-Term Development Framework (2012–2015) aimed to modernize existing irrigation infrastructure and implement reforms to improve service delivery.10 The Punjab Growth Strategy 2018 acknowledged MFF-financed projects as a key investment in improving the irrigation infrastructure.11 The evaluation of the country assistance program viewed as appropriate ADB’s commitment in responding to rehabilitate and expand the Indus River irrigation system.12"
1,"Technical assistance for institutional and regulatory issues. Technical assistance should be attached to the project to support implementation of the soft components, including those on tariffs, nontariff measures, corporate governance, and gender, given the reluctance of executing agencies to finance such activities from the loan. Having these measures supported through an ADB-administered technical assistance will enable ADB to play a more active catalytic and facilitation role among key government stakeholders, thus raising the chances of the soft components being more effectively implemented."
1,Climate proofing. Failures on one of the rehabilitated sections of the Liquica– Batugade road highlight the need for additional efforts to improve climate proofing through embankment and slope stabilization. A technical audit conducted by an independent geotechnical consultant proposed measures that are summarized in a forthcoming report (footnote 11).
0,"During the investment program preparation, potential gender benefits and impacts on local communities and vulnerable groups were analyzed through a stakeholder consultation workshop, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and small-sample surveys. The women who were consulted on the Project 1 roads strongly endorsed the road improvements. They expected to be able to increase their agricultural production and to expand into new crops and animal rearing. As a result, they anticipated increasing their market sales. They felt that they would have faster (and perhaps cheaper) access to health care facilities. Road improvements would enable their children to go to schools and, in general, their communities would have better access to government services. The gender division of labor and women’s traditional exclusion from the benefits derived from road rehabilitation and maintenance works were clearly identified during focus group discussions with public works constructors. The investment program would seek to give women more access to jobs provided by the road improvement by encouraging civil works contractors to increase the percentage of women workers to 30% of the labor force, and to carry out gender-sensitive HIV prevention and road safety awareness in the project area."
0,"However, the three DISCOMs continue to record accounting losses, and the covenanted debt service coverage ratio of 1.2 and the self-financing ratio of 20% have not yet been achieved but are improving progressively (footnote 33). This is mainly due to the underachievement of the loss trajectories set by the MPERC (resulting in under-recovery of power purchase costs and consequently lower operating cash flow). Despite under-achievement against the MPERC’s loss targets and current loss levels, loss reduction has still been remarkable, with an achievement of an estimated 5,000 MW of peak losses and 13,000 GWh of energy losses avoided (representing around 20% of the total revenue across the three DISCOMs in FY2016). Given these levels of losses, the balance sheets of the three DISCOMs are characterized by negative equity and levels of long-term debt (to the state government) that are not yet sustainable. To mitigate financial risks, DISCOMs continue to pursue systematic improvement through various financial and technical intermediations, supplementing separation of household and agricultural feeders, enhancing energy based livelihoods for Women Micro entrepreneurs, and strengthening capacity in the distribution sector with active participation of stakeholders and strengthening of billing and collection (including the collection of arrears) as better cash flow management, which will aid in meeting the loan covenants. Furthermore, MPERC, in association with the executing agencies, is rationalizing the tariff by taking into cognizance of distribution losses, billing and collection efficiency leading to modest annual tariff increases and is keeping public appraised about the due diligence procedure followed. Further, the delay in meeting the covenants did not impact project execution or the ongoing operation of the project-supplied facilities."
0,"The project was physically completed in June 2013 and financially closed in June 2017. The project closing was delayed because of the two-year suspension of loan, lengthy procedure of implementing NGOs’ selection process and delays in liquidating the advances to NGOs and consulting firms. 7 The DNFE was established under the first Non-Formal Education Project (ADB. 1995.

0,"The expected impact of the investment program was reduced poverty and improved health and living standards in the CRB by 2023. As PFR2 and following tranches have been cancelled, the investment program’s impact will not be fully achieved, therefore, it is rated less than satisfactory. The PFR1 expected impact was “improved and more integrated water resource management in place.” The achievement of the impact was tracked by three indicators: (i) an appropriate and effective institutional arrangement for IWRM in CRB; (ii) effective partnership among the government agencies at the national, provincial, and district level to implement the basin plan; and (iii) comprehensive and accessible databases to implement IWRM. The first indicator has been achieved as the river basin council has been established, comprised of 50% government and nongovernment members, and the MPWH has legalized Pola (strategic basin plan) and Rencana (implementation plan). The second indicator was partially achieved. While there has been an initiative to incorporate IWRM into regional plans through the Citarum Bestari, the allocated budget is far less than the required financing. The third indicator was achieved. The government will, however, have to ensure that the necessary funding and human resources are allocated to maintain those databases. Therefore, PFR1 is rated less than satisfactory."

0,"The overall road construction costs for project 1 exceeded the appraisal estimates despite the reduction in scope. The reasons for the cost increases were: (i) the unit construction cost estimated during preparation was based on road-improvement contracts ongoing at that time under supplementary financing for the Road Maintenance and Upgrading (Sector) Project, which focused on rehabilitation; however, during the detailed engineering designof the project 1 roads, it was determined that these unpaved roads needed not only sealing, but also major improvements in road geometry and drainage; (ii) the LNG project raised unit costs in the construction industry nationwide; (iii) the replacement, upgrading, and/or reconstruction of seven bridges for the Mendi–Kandep road and nine bridges for the Laiagam–Porgera road were unplanned; (iv) payment to the PNG defense and police forces to maintain law and order at the construction sites was unforeseen; and (v) increased land compensation claims. Table 4 compares the estimated and actual construction costs. These cost increases will reduce the financial and economic rates of return for project 1. Table 4: Road Construction Cost Overruns (K million)"
1,"The project schedule developed at appraisal required all project contracts to be awarded  either before or immediately after grant approval and did not provide for an interval between grant  approval and grant effectivity. This was unrealistic. Furthermore, even though a grant covenant  required that the contractor shall not be allowed access to any section of the line route until all  resettlement issues were resolved, the project schedule made no provision for their resolution. In  an EPC contract—in which the contractor is responsible for design—the design approval,  resolution of resettlement issues, and construction are sequential activities, and this should be  provided in the project schedule. Project schedules should also incorporate realistic timeframes  for processing of contracts, and ideally provide some accommodation for inevitable delays."

1,"After the program was approved, Mongolia’s economy worsened before showing signs of improvement in 2017. Mongolia remains vulnerable because of its high debt levels, a fragile banking sector, and higher poverty rates. Nevertheless, it remains on track to stabilize its economy and exit the current IMF EFF in a stronger position than when it entered it. This improved outlook has required a great deal of effort on the part of the authorities to make the necessary adjustments. The program played an important role in initiating a framework for fiscal consolidation without withdrawing the much-needed social welfare support for the poor at a time of economic difficulty. There is more work to do, both to ensure the hard-won fiscal prudence is sustained and the expenditure allocated to social welfare is used as efficiently as possible through better targeting and consolidation. These challenges continue today and should remain a focus of ADB’s engagement in Mongolia."
0,"Institutional development. Building on the capacity development support during the past ADB intervention, the associated TA has strengthened the institutional development of MPRDC in road safety management and private sector participation in road construction and maintenance. During implementation, the construction supervision consultants provided substantial training on various aspects of road project management. With continuous institutional capacity improvement since MPRDC was established in 2004, MPRDC now manages a vast network of 19,165 km of roads as compared to 2,352 km in 2006. MPRDC is now focusing on road safety and network sustainability, and planning initiatives for technology-based solutions. The ARS has significantly improved road safety management and accident response. Senior officials from many states in India including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Orissa, Sikkim and Rajasthan have visited MPRDC to understand and explore the possibility of replicating the ARS, besides two multilateral development agencies. Further enhancement and expansion of ARS will evolve with greater experience and user feedback."

Despite the 4-year delay, the following deliverables were produced: (i) a water quality improvement strategy for the CRB; (ii) a community action plan for point source management of water quality; and (iii) a water quality monitoring and database system. Small pilots for water quality improvement were also implemented with communities. The MOE cancelled the civil works, equipment, and training allocation ($2.3 million).

The borrower failed to increase tariffs annually to a level that will ensure the financial sustainability of the executing agencies, whose limited mandate prevents them from implementing such challenging policy action. Such an action requires a complex approach through a well-designed communication strategy; effective coordination and capacity building, if needed, with all government stakeholders (Tariff Council, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, and Cabinet of Ministers’ concerned departments); and development of the public utilities’ capacity and tools on scenario-based estimation of WSS tariffs."
0,"ADB disbursed $33.8 million of its loan. This is only 52% of the approved loan amount. The reasons for low disbursement are explained in para 25. DFID grant disbursed $0.44 million (22% of $2 million), and SDC grant disbursed $4.93 million (98.6% of the committed amount). Disbursement of 87% of the ADB loan and DFID and SDC grants used ADB’s advance fund and statement of expenditures procedures, while the remaining 13% used ADB’s direct payment procedure. Disbursement started in 2002, and financial closure stretched to 2017, reflecting the project implementation delay and slow liquation of the advances.

0,"General socioeconomic status. The project road is located in the southeastern part of the country, where agriculture and livestock are the main source of income and the poverty incidence is among the highest in the Kyrgyz Republic. Agricultural land produces mainly barley and potato, with 22,878 hectares of permanent grass land and 698,435 hectares of pasture land. In 2016 major livestock consisted of sheep (186,376), goats (44,010), cattle (35,975), horses (24,875), and fowl (21,948). The population of the the At-Bashy Rayon increased from about 53,000 in 2011 to 62,700 in 2016. At-Bashy is the largest village near the project road, which is located at kilometer (km) 387 of the Bishkek–Torugart road, with a population of about 14,000 people in 2016. About 99% of the people in the project impact areas are ethnic Kyrgyz. The remaining ethnic groups (Uzbeks, Uigurs, Tatars, Kazakhs, Ukrainians, Russians, and Dungans) have been integrated into the respective towns and villages. About 41.5% of families in the At- Bashy Rayon in January 2016 were classified as low-income (living on less than Som1,465.7 per person per month), which represented a decrease from 58.7% in 2012.

For the Kyrgyz Republic, with its long dependence on the former Soviet Union, some equipment is still procured from the Russian Federation, the only source where such equipment is available. For an interim period, a waiver from the ADB should be requested for procurement from the Russian Federation."
1,"There is also a need for dedicated project managers to assume responsibility for and ownership of each ADB-financed project. Currently, a DISCO’s PMU is organized along functional lines and responsibility for project completion is unclear. In this situation, project management tends to be reactive rather than proactive and makes the project prone to delays. This is particularly important where activities such as planning, design, procurement, and construction are delegated to various departments and undertaken by persons not reporting directly to the PMU. It is also suggested to conduct comprehensive capacity assessment of the executing and implementing agencies and a market analysis before proposing bid packaging; propose a risk mitigation action plan, including capacity building measures; and make use of advance contracting aligned with the land acquisition plan. There was also a lack of ownership in tenders’ evaluation and delays in timely delivery of the AEFS. These issues can be addressed in the future through improving the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies."

1,"Three private vocational colleges who borrowed from the on-lending facility have an institution-specific gender strategy. Each vocational college each had a proposal for a gender strategy, there was no confirmation that they implemented those strategies because of a lack of monitoring mechanism. However, the project lesson learned showed that each vocational college should have a break-through strategy to promote girl participation in non-traditional occupations based on their own situation. To do this, each vocational college should pay more attention to explore the hidden factors that limit female participation and having initiatives to develop the collaboration with employers to address gender issues in recruitment."
0,"Incremental revenue from reduced distribution losses. Transmission and distribution loss trajectories are set by MPERC at the start of each regulatory period. DISCOMs can recover electricity purchase costs in accordance with MPERC’s loss trajectories and TRANCSO can recover its ARR across its available network capacity including approved transmission losses. If DISCOMs achieve loss levels lower than the trajectories set by MPERC, they retain the saving in electricity purchase cost, and if they cannot meet MPERC’s distribution loss trajectories, some electricity purchase costs cannot be recovered from customers and instead have to be absorbed by the DISCOMs. 2 A similar mechanism applies to Transco. However, unlike Transco the DISCOMs have struggled meet MPERC’s loss trajectories and this has been the main cause of their financial losses. The Design and Monitoring Framework (DMF) shows that losses have reduced significantly during MFF implementation (some but not all of which is attributable to MFF investments), with average (unweighted) losses at 24.4% for FY2016 compared to 38.1% for FY2009. At aggregate FY2016 sales levels (61,650 gigawatt-hours [GWh]) and using estimated variable electricity purchase rates (₹ 3.0 per kilowatt-hour [kWh]), this represents incremental revenue to the DISCOMs of around ₹ 24 billion (approximately 10% of aggregate FY2016 revenue for the three DISCOMs), underscoring the importance and financial value of addressing losses. 7.    Table A15.1 shows the FIRR and WACC for each project as estimated during appraisal  and as reevaluated during preparation of PCRs for each project (the details of which are not repeated here). The FIRR and WACC for the MFF are shown at the bottom of the table (financial costs of each project were adjusted to a common 2015 base for weighting purposes). As appraised, the FIRR for the overall MFF was approximately 10.5% compared to the reevaluated EIRR for the MFF of 15.9%. The reevaluated WACC was slightly lower than as appraised, mostly because actual equity contribution was low or zero in most projects (versus an assumption during appraisal that equity would constitute 10-20% of capital). The overall FIRR for the MFF comfortably exceeds the WACC, indicating an expectation of a solid financial return on the investment. Table A15.1: MFF Financial Internal Rate of Return by Project (2015 base)	(2015	(%)	(%)	(%)	(%)  	base)	 Weighted averages:	10.5	15.9	3.5	2.0 2 Under current regulations, under/over-recoveries of generation costs due to under/over-achievement of the loss trajectories set by MPERC are shared between DISCOMs and their customers in the ratio 2:1. That is (and for example), for every rupee of under-recovered generation purchase cost, DISCOMs are allowed by MPERC to include 33 paisa in tariffs with the balance of 66 paisa representing a loss for DISCOMs. a/ As adopted for FIRR estimations. b/ This value appears to have been adopted in error in the analysis at the time.

0,"The Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment Program was approved as a multitranche financing facility (MFF) in February 2007.1 It aimed to install high tension transmission and distribution system lines to replace inefficient low-tension lines, rehabilitate existing distribution transformer stations, construct new transformer stations, and separate rural and village feeder lines to enable better service to remote rural areas in Madhya Pradesh, a large state in central India. The MFF included a proposed $25 million grant from the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom focused on capacity building. However, this was later shifted to support a technical assistance cluster and parallel facility focused on gender inclusivity.2 The MFF was delivered through 6 projects. Projects 1 and 3 were for the expansion and refurbishment of the power transmission system. Project 2 was for urgent distribution system improvements in the eastern part of the state. Projects 4 and 5 included financing for each of the distribution companies (DISCOMs) to expand and improve their distribution systems in rural areas while Project 6 included the remaining distribution system expansion by DISCOM-E, computerization and system control and data acquisition (SCADA), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) functions for each DISCOM. Project 6 also financed the installation of business integration, power purchase functions, and operational management systems for the Madhya Pradesh Power Management Company Limited (MPPMCL). 3 The scope of the facility is summarized in the Framework Financing Agreement in Appendix 1. The specific outputs of project 6 are in the design and monitoring framework (DMF) in Appendix 2."

1,"Clearly defined monitoring responsibilities and mechanisms for adjustment. Detailed environmental and social stipulations in concession agreements are effective, but they require monitoring and a mechanism for adjustment. The Concession Agreement is highly detailed: this has probably ensured that NTPC paid greater attention to social and environmental requirements, but it may also have enabled a government with weak capacity to rely on NTPC’s diligence rather than regulating concession agreement stipulations effectively. The government and IFIs could have clarified the monitoring of concession agreement commitments. In addition, a mechanism for adjustments in the details on meeting concession agreement commitments— such as defining quantitative targets on incomes and the livelihood sustainability, but not fundamentals such as entitlements—without having to amend the concession agreement itself would have been of practical value."

The estimated works were based on preliminary design as only general knowledge of the shortfalls in the existing distribution system were known at the time of appraisal. The DISCOMs carried out the appraisals without the assistance of consultants or detailed field surveys due to the non-availability of advanced technology such as system mapping or detailed records including energy audits of the hundreds of transformer stations and related equipment. 18 Since the distribution systems consisted of thousands of kilometers of distribution line, tens of thousands of transformers, and related equipment, it was not economically or timewise feasible to do a detailed assessment of their condition and, as a result, an elaborate system design was not technically feasible. Rather, ADB agreed that the design– build approach was best for this type of work and approved the DISCOMs’ request to implement the works on a design–build basis. Under the design-build approach, the ICB included equipment supply and installation, with the contractor responsible for testing and quantity survey in the field with the works adjusted based on the actual conditions found on the ground. Through subsequent projects, the DISCOMs continued to strengthen their planning, design, implementation, and operational capabilities, including ADB’s requirements for safeguards monitoring and reporting.19"

0,"During the investment program preparation, potential gender benefits and impacts on local communities and vulnerable groups were analyzed through a stakeholder consultation workshop, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and small-sample surveys. The women who were consulted on the Project 1 roads strongly endorsed the road improvements. They expected to be able to increase their agricultural production and to expand into new crops and animal rearing. As a result, they anticipated increasing their market sales. They felt that they would have faster (and perhaps cheaper) access to health care facilities. Road improvements would enable their children to go to schools and, in general, their communities would have better access to government services. The gender division of labor and women’s traditional exclusion from the benefits derived from road rehabilitation and maintenance works were clearly identified during focus group discussions with public works constructors.

They also took the lead in sustaining project activities, ensuring compliance with social safeguard and loan covenants, and executing monitoring and evaluation. The PMUs supervised the implementation and reporting on the gender action and ethnic group plans. Provincial expenditures and accounts were closely monitored to ensure suitable investments and the topping-up of provincial subaccounts. Through training and practice, provincial staff improved their competency in results- based planning. PIUs staff also received training and district staff received orientation on results- based planning. In addition, PIUs were trained on integrating CDC in AOPs, including training plans, cross-border activities, and malaria incidence targets. Guidance manuals on procurement and disbursement were made available, and project staff received related orientation. Results- based planning was observed in the preparation of the 5-year implementation plan for the project and the AOPs for each country.

At completion, the project constructed and opened a good quality expressway of 55 km with 4 lanes, which is operated by a joint stock company.29 The project expressway is in an important section of the transport corridor connecting HCMC and Dau Giay and part of the Southern Focal Economic Area, an important industrial developing area in southern Viet Nam. According to VEC traffic counts, the actual traffic in 2018 increased by 13.1% for the HCMC–Long Thanh section and 14.6% for the Long Thanh–Dau Giay section. Travel time on the project expressway dropped at least 50% from 90 minutes to 45 minutes. The vehicle operation cost (VOC) fell by 30% on average. Meanwhile, the traffic congestion on the parallel highway has also been substantially alleviated. Hence, the operation of the project expressway has supported HCMC port exports and sustainable economic development in the project areas (para. )."

For example, he cooks food when I have to attend the meeting”. meeting would be the start of a journey to increased empowerment for her. Most of the participants to the meeting were women. Participants were explained about cash-for-work (CFW) opportunities under the additional financing. They were also told that they need to form a Committee for each sub-project with at least one woman in the Committee. Sophea got elected by the villagers to become the Deputy Chief of the Committee of one connecting road sub-project. The two other elected members were one woman (to be accountant) and a man (to be the Chief). They all got elected by the villagers because they can read and write. Sophea studied up to grade 3 while the Chief studied up to grade 4. Unlike the two other members, it was the first time for Sophea to take up a leadership role in her community. She was lucky because she had a very supportive husband. He supported her to take up this role of Deputy Chief when she got elected. And she also said: “My husband helped me with the domestic chores when I was busy with my work for the Committee. He was cooking and taking care of the  children.” She and her family also got an opportunity to participate in the CFW activities of the sub-project. The total income earned through their participation in the CFW activities amounts to 500,000 Riel (equivalent to about 125 USD). This money meant a lot to them. Sophea used it to meet basic needs  such as buying clothes for their children, rice, medicine and ingredients for cooking. However, she also used part of this money more strategically to invest in the start-up of a mini grocery shop, which is up running since May this year (after completion of the road sub-project in April)."

The MFF approach was utilized to facilitate the implementation of successive interventions based on the priorities set by TRANSCO and the DISCOMs. The MFF approach also facilitated sequential implementation of the MFF’s slice of the sector road map. The government considered it appropriate that a more flexible modality would fit the sector’s requirement given the growing complexity and size of the project loans. The energy sector had strong road maps in place, was strongly supported by India’s national and state government policies and there were urgent demands for improved power delivery, as much of the infrastructure suffered from years of neglect and had massive transmission and distribution losses. The large state power entities had extensive experience in planning, design, and implementation of large regional projects. Given these, it was logical for the sector to adopt an MFF modality. The Madhya Pradesh power MFF was one of the first programs in the Indian energy sector to use this modality and, while there were some initial growing pains with the new format, there were no major issues (paras. 46-50). The DISCOMs followed a judiciously conceived district approach that focused on remote poorly served rural areas of districts and where intervention would provide the most benefits.13 The international competitive bidding (ICB) contracts under the six projects required that technical optimization and actual on- the-ground conditions be applied (i.e., adjustments on designs, specifications, and scope of works to achieve intended output)."

The project achieved an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 26.0%, which is higher than the threshold discount rate of 12% but less than the EIRR of 35.3% envisaged at appraisal. The major reasons for the lower EIRR are (i) the 39% employment rate at the end of training, which was much lower than the 90% expected at appraisal; and (ii) the long project implementation period."

The outputs addressed both immediate consumption-support needs and the medium- and longer- term development objectives were designed to improve agriculture productivity and put in place a national system of food reserves to avert future crises. There was a clear public good  rationale for the investment. The project was entirely consistent with ADB’s stated policy response to the global situation at the time. While the major change in scope resulting from the seeds supply problem could have been foreseen, the change was timely and it did not substantially affect the originally intended outcome.

1,"The project schedule developed at appraisal required all project contracts to be awarded either before or immediately after grant approval and did not provide for an interval between grant approval and grant effectivity. This was unrealistic. Furthermore, even though a grant covenant required that the contractor shall not be allowed access to any section of the line route until all resettlement issues were resolved, the project schedule made no provision for their resolution. In an EPC contract—in which the contractor is responsible for design—the design approval, resolution of resettlement issues, and construction are sequential activities, and this should be provided in the project schedule. Project schedules should also incorporate realistic timeframes for processing of contracts, and ideally provide some accommodation for inevitable delays."

With the realization of the SASECRN, it was expected that Nepal and Bhutan would have a superior option of bigger internet access capacity from CLS, through connection to the cable landing stations (CLS) in Bangladesh and India through access gateways, and then terrestrial links, compared to connection through satellites on which these two countries had relied on. Accessing internet using satellite, in particular very small aperture terminals, that were used by these two countries, were understood to be twice expensive than terrestrial links in the original analysis. Economic analysis at appraisal assumed that the Project would enable the two countries to purchase internet access capacity at least three times bigger: 620 megabytes for Nepal and 155 megabytes for Bhutan. Also, since the CLS were located in Bangladesh and India, it was expected that revenues were generated to be paid by Nepal and Bhutan to Bangladesh and India for connection through the CLS."

Traffic signage and concrete barriers on roadsides on curves and elevated areas are important safety features. In addition, bridges and general visibility along the route have been improved. Safety remains an issue as vehicle speeds and traffic density have increased. There were no significant adverse environmental impacts during project implementation. The main issues arising during construction—including dust and site restoration—were assessed, and mitigations measures were identified and implemented. The camp and manufacturing areas were demobilized and returned to their pre-project condition. A project specific spill control system was designed and constructed within the Karatal-Japaryk State Nature Reserve protected area adjacent to the alignment to trap any accidental spills and prevent them reaching the Chatyr-Kul Lake. In addition, spill control equipment was handed over and training of the local road maintenance unit personnel carried out. To improve the management capacity of the Karatal-Japaryk State Nature Reserve, training in monitoring and management was carried out and equipment provided, including a four- wheel drive vehicle, boat, mobile accommodation (trailer), water quality monitoring equipment, camera traps, and laptops and printers.

The loan proceeds were disbursed in accordance with ADB’s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Pursuant to ADB’s reimbursement procedures, the Government of India provided the loan proceeds in local currency to the state government on the same terms and conditions as received from ADB. The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure for reimbursement of individual payments not exceeding $100,000 was not used because the individual payments far exceeded the threshold, which suggests the potential for a higher threshold for future projects. Under retroactive financing, the first loan disbursement was made on 9 September 2011. The loan disbursements then peaked in 2012 ($54.6 million) and 2013 ($60.3 million), representing 18% and 20% of original loan amount, respectively.

1,"Frequency of policy-based programs. Providing policy-based budget support every 2 years risks creating a pattern of the government only pursuing essential reforms during the program period. Through the CEWG mechanism, ADB has previously agreed to provide budget support in alternate years to the World Bank, mitigating the risk of negatively impacting the government’s reform mindset. However, because the government failed to endorse the CEWG joint EFRP policy matrix in 2015, this cycle was interrupted (para. 7). ADB should consider reimplementing the alternating cycle with the World Bank (and/or other CEWG development partners), two-tranche stand-alone grants, or programmatic grants to support continuous and sustainable government reforms. Preparation, implementation, and completion of policy-based programs are time and resource intensive, so increasing the frequency of such programs is not recommended."

Minor environmental impacts in varying degrees, such as incomplete personal protective equipment for laborers, inadequate dust control, and poor labor and camp site management were observed in all road sections. As manifested in the DOR’s semi-annual environmental monitoring report corroborated by the annual reviews, the environmental performance among the contractors widely varied.

0,"The project was an appropriate response to a national crisis in Cambodia. Analytical work already undertaken in 2008 by ADB,9 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Bank had identified that international prices of food, fertilizers, and fuel had soared from mid-2007 to early 2008, and that this was already having major adverse impacts on poverty reduction, including in Cambodia. An important dimension of the ongoing food crisis—and one that would directly influence project’s design—was that a large segment of Cambodia’s population in both rural and urban areas comprised net food buyers, most of whom were poor or near-poor. Larger expenditures on food caused by higher prices consequently reduced expenditures on health, education, and productive agriculture inputs. 6 ADB. 2011.

1,"ADB’s future support for forestry in Viet Nam will be guided by two key considerations: (i) Viet Nam’s graduation from ADB’s concessional lending at the end of 2018; and (ii) the government’s policy of on-lending to provinces, in line with the State Budget Law. On both accounts, the government will expect future lending to meet several criteria, including (i) a blend of grant and loan funds, which will match ADB’s concessional lending terms; (ii) direct revenue- generating potential from the investment of public funds; and (iii) borrowing head room and the ability of participating provinces to repay loans. ADB and the government may explore opportunities to structure an investment loan that meets these criteria during country programming and country partnership strategy discussions. A follow-on investment that builds on the project’s outcomes and supports a long-term strategy of inclusive and market-oriented forest resource development management for climate resilience would be consistent with ADB’s country partnership strategy, 2016–2020 for Viet Nam, specifically, Pillar 3 (improving environmental sustainability and climate change response).28 It could also be an attractive proposition for collaborative financing with the private sector or with the Green Climate Fund.

However, between 2002 and 2016, physical cultivation area is declining at an average rate of 2% per year, from 58,331 to 48,730 ha. This is due to the conversion of agricultural land for other purposes. As land conversion is driven by macro-socioeconomic factors, this analysis assumes that cultivation area continues to decline with or without the project, and at an annual rate of 2% per year throughout the analytical timeframe."

0,"Productivity benefits. At the end of the project, the economic benefits of the project in terms of productivity gains is estimated at around $43.6 million (in 2010 $), lower than the $85.2 million estimated at appraisal. At the appraisal, the project was expected to reduce the disease burden of dengue fever by 20% and by 90% for intestinal worm over the operational life of the project. Given that the baseline disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for both diseases were actually higher than initially projected based on 2004 WHO data, the expected percentage reductions in disease burden were adjusted to a more conservative value for both diseases (10%). But as in the appraisal, the productivity benefits throughout the project implementation were quantified at project completion in terms of the value of the expected reductions disease burden across project areas. It is estimated by multiplying the average income or cost of labor by the gains in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per disease among the working-age population across project areas.2 The DALY disease burden comprises mortality, captured through years of life lost, and years lived with disability."

0,"Institutional development component. At appraisal, the project envisaged the improved road safety capacity of MPRDC and allocated $1.0 million for purchasing related equipment. During implementation, the Madhya Pradesh government considered that road safety and vehicle overloading can be better addressed through a comprehensive integrated programmatic approach and the involvement of all stakeholders. The government therefore focused on the development and operationalization of an emergency road accident response system (ARS). It developed ARS with assistance from the TA consultants and implemented it statewide in coordination with other related initiatives that entailed the purchase of equipment using its own funds. Upon operationalization, training courses were conducted on the ARS in addition to other road safety trainings. To further enhance road safety, MPRDC, with private sector participation, established computer-networked check-posts at all the 24 entry points along the state borders to address the overloading issue. For implementation of the ARS, the government procured equipment worth $1.56 million through its own funds as it enabled optimal use of its resources from related initiatives and was administratively more convenient. At completion, the project component of the improved road safety capacity of MPRDC was fully achieved."

The main issues related to PSE reforms are whether corporatization and privatization are feasible, how much funding they will require, and whether the reforms will lead to improved business performance. The government will need to conduct rigorous cost–benefit analysis and social and environmental impact assessment for privatization proposals. Useful guidance could be obtained from the auditors’ reports of previous corporatizations and privatizations. In addition, alternative ways to improve the performance of PSEs could be explored. Type of structure or ownership arrangements may not be the most crucial issue to address at this stage. Appointment of professional board members and management personnel may be the first step for PSEs to improve business performance. In addition, the government needs to be consistent in its policy implementation and in expediting the privatization process as per an approved plan.

The ADB mission in October 2014 found that most of the contractors had improved their performance and the issue of the shortage of aggregates had been largely resolved. By the extended loan closing date of December 2015, 8 out of 13 civil works contract packages had been completed while another 2 had achieved about 95% physical progress. The remaining 3 contracts, including the 2 new contracts for completing the remaining works of the terminated contracts, had achieved 80% physical progress. In these circumstances, ADB approved further extensions of the loan closing date by total 6 months to enable MPRDC to fully complete the works and achieve the intended project objectives. Eventually, all civil works contracts were completed by the extended loan closing date of 30 June 2016."

The project outcome was improved hydraulic management of the Dili water supply system and more efficient tertiary distribution with a reduction in the Dili water system’s non-revenue water (NRW) from 95% to 40%–50%, and in the project target zones, reducing the NRW from 95% to 25%–30%, and the percentage of the population receiving 24-hour water supply increasing from 40% to 80%."
1,"Design and monitoring framework. It is recommended that the DMF indicators are established more accurately to assess benefits attributable to the project. For example, electricity supply increase is not solely attributed to the improved transmission network capacity and rather determined by actual demand growth. Therefore, whether electricity demand growth is met would have been a more appropriate impact indicator. For the outcome, the additional transmission capacity attributable to the project would be more appropriate."
1,"Clear institutional structures and budgetary commitments. The NNT-NPA illustrates the need for clear objectives, institutional planning, and budgetary commitments as pre-requisites for transformational projects. Biodiversity offsets require clear definition of both the underlying biodiversity values and accountability for achieving the offsets. The NNT-NPA area far exceeded the areas of habitat lost in the project footprint for almost all habitat types, and no attempt was made to focus on areas within the NNT-NPA that correspond to habitats or species populations lost in the project footprint. Following the polluter-pays-principle, a developer should be accountable for conserving defined biodiversity values of an offset, rather than only providing finance. Plans must clearly distinguish between (i) avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating biodiversity impacts, (ii) compensating through offsets for unavoidable impacts, and (iii) supporting wider conservation efforts and the government’s commitments to conserve biodiversity. Relying on an entirely new government organization (WMPA) to conserve the NNT- NPA was a significant risk, which could have been mitigated by involving global conservation nongovernmental organizations from the beginning and mobilizing long term, international technical expertise, to improve the government’s capacity at national and local levels to manage the environment and fulfill the function of an environmental regulator in the long term."

At appraisal, the WTC Operator charged a raw water tariff of 87 IDR/m3, which was underpriced and is less than 35% of O&M costs.5 Since then, the tariffs were adjusted periodically, although they are still insufficient to recoup WTC’s O&M costs (paras. 34 and 35). Note that there is no tariff relating to irrigation water. For the DMI users, tariff adjustment for the Jakarta water utilizes (PDAM Jaya) has been frequent. For the other two client groups (non-Jakarta utilities and industrial users), adjustments were sparse, such that the tariffs decreased in real terms for some years. The evaluation assumes that the real tariff will continue to increase at an average growth rates of 0.47%, 1.96%, and 2.69% for the three client groups. This assumption will affect the financial analysis, but not the economic analysis, as the economic value of water depends not on the financial tariff price but rather on the water users’ willingness to pay.

0,"Reevaluation of the economic internal rate of return. Table A10.1 presents the economic reevaluation. The EIRR is estimated to be 26.0%, lower than the 35.3% calculated at appraisal. This discrepancy is mainly due to the following reasons: (i) the actual lower employment of 39% against the envisaged 90%, and (ii) the longer period (12 years) of project implementation compared to the planned implementation period (6 years). These negative factors on the economic return were partially offset by (i) the actual incremental wage of $0.28 per day, which is slightly higher than the assumed $0.25 per day at appraisal, and (ii) the lower project cost by 48% than the cost at appraisal."
0,"This financial reevaluation considers the network and IT investments undertaken by DISCOM-C and the IT investments undertaken by DISCOM-E and DISCOM-W under Project 6, based on actual capital cost and estimated benefit streams.1 The unit of account selected was Indian rupees (₹). Financial benefits flowing to the DISCOMs consist primarily of an increase in regulated revenue accruing from newly constructed distribution facilities: an annual revenue requirement (ARR) for each DISCOM is determined by the jurisdictional regulator, Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC), based on MPERC’s view of reasonable and efficient capital costs, power purchase costs, operations and maintenance (O&M) costs, overhead costs, depreciation, interest on loans and on working capital, and return on equity. To assess financial viability, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the investment was calculated and compared with the total investment’s financial internal rate of return (FIRR)."
0,"Overall the DISCOM-C has been successful in its efforts to reduce losses: aggregate energy losses reduced to 25.1% in FY2016 from 41.6% in FY2009. However, the project was one of a number of interventions made by DISCOM-C over the period to reduce technical and non- technical losses (and it is noted that many of the subprojects in this investment targeted reliability and quality of supply rather than loss reduction). To estimate the actual loss reduction that can be reasonably attributed to the project, as noted above subproject analysis conducted during appraisal (which was based on load flow analysis conducted by DISCOM-C) was updated to reflect actual capital costs and physical outcomes of the project. A study conducted under the multitranche financing facility regarding the impact on losses of the introduction of HVDS was also reviewed and its findings incorporated.3 On this basis, aggregate loss reduction achieved by the project (by 2018) was estimated at 476 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per annum (including low voltage, 11kV and 33kV losses), representing approximately 0.75% (out of the total loss reduction of 19%). This is a very conservative estimate and includes only 50% of estimated non-technical loss reduction accruing from the project. On the basis of discussions with DISCOM-C, it was estimated that 30% of the loss reduction arising from component 1 is technical losses and 70% is non- technical losses. For component 2 the estimated loss reduction split is 80% technical loss and 20% non-technical."
1,"Assessment of capacity of executing agency. During project preparation, a comprehensive and realistic assessment of executing and implementing agencies’ capacities would have led to the improved design of the project targets and the implementation arrangements.

A larger and diversified project like this requires government to assign experienced and dedicated staff from various segments. Although appointment of counterpart staff is the government’s internal affair, ADB should have had effective dialogue with the government and helped identify appropriate staff, and timely supplemented with good international consultants to fill the key positions and helped in procurement processes."

0,"The economic internal rates of return (EIRR) to ascertain project efficiency for water supply, wastewater, urban drainage, and urban transport components were assessed upon project completion and compared with appraisal estimates. At appraisal, EIRR was computed for four sample interventions in three urban local bodies (ULBs) viz. (i) water supply in Chittorgarh, (ii) sewerage in Bharatpur, (iii) urban drainage in Sawai Madhopur, and (iv) urban transport in Sawai Madhopur. At completion, economic evaluation for all subprojects were undertaken, due to the economic significance of the interventions. The EIRR was not computed for the solid waste management component in Bundi as the intervention was dropped. Economic reevaluation also includes sensitivity analysis, at a 20% reduction of future benefits."
1,"Sensitivity to institutional resistance. Predictably, the readiness of line ministries to embrace a new concept like RIA was somewhat limited. Thus, to institutionalize RIA, the government planned to issue a Royal Decree, by the King, which would have ensured the unanimous participation of all line ministries early in the process. However, ORIA opted for a sub-decree issued by the Prime Minister that only required consultation with a RIA expert and not the full approval of the cabinet.  As a result, the  RIA program  began with  only seven  of  the  31 line-ministries participating. Grant resources then had to be reallocated to advocacy, and related capacity development extended beyond the originally anticipated timelines. As a result, the implementation of the reforms slowed, and the project timeline had to be extended. In response, Government Decision No. 132 was issued on 26 December 2016, and required all line ministries and government institutions to establish RIA working groups in their respective offices. As such, efficient implementation of new concepts, like RIA, should be directly supported by the government by way of mandatory participation to shorten uptake times."
0,"Monitoring and reporting: The contract documents under the MFF, including project 3, included the environmental monitoring and management plans (EMMPs). The contractors’ staff were provided training to understand the requirements elaborated in the EMMPs. The overall implementation of EMMPs was improved through systematic execution of action plans identified during the review missions and semi-annual environmental monitoring reports. The areas of concern such as safety measures at sites, provision of basic amenities to laborers, housekeeping practices, etc. improved with increased monitoring and coordination. The environmental parameter test reports adequately captured the test results of air, water qualities and noise levels parameters and submission of semi-annual environmental monitoring reports were regular. These monitoring reports captured the status of regulatory compliances and implementation of EMMPs, etc. adequately, and were disclosed on ADB website. The project authorities confirmed that there are no outstanding issues and/or any court cases related to environmental safeguards at completion. Overall, environmental safeguard compliance, except for continued renewal of CTOs post-loan closure, was assessed to be satisfactory."
0,"During project implementation, eight semi-annual monitoring reports from March 2012 to August 2015 were submitted by the DOR and disclosed in compliance with ADB environmental requirements for category A projects. The DOR fielded an independent review of the environmental safeguard compliance for four consecutive years from 2012 to 2015 to validate monitoring reports, ensure all significant environmental impacts are identified and mitigated, and conduct consultations to assess the overall compliance of the project. In addition to these special review missions, the ADB’s South Asia Transport and Communication Division conducted eight review missions from 2010 to 2015, of which four missions included environmental safeguard evaluation."

Second, to the extent possible, maintain continuity in the project administration of both ADB and the executing agency throughout the implementation period. Third, as disaster and emergency assistance investment experience accumulates, continue to review, and if necessary revise, the recommendations of the DEAP and its action plan, including ensuring that a disaster focal point is designated at resident missions to implement the DEAP.39 Last, for greater gender sensitivity, (i) promote gender equality through project’s gender design elements contributed to poverty reduction, greater food security, and women’s empowerment; (ii) engage more men in education, communications and training and outreach activities to play roles in family nutrition, such as in cooking demonstrations; and (iii) share information on the direct and indirect benefits of the project with women to boost their participation before implementing the activities."

ULBs and state bodies meet O&M costs of all urban services through well-structured and planned budgetary allocations based on a revenue- sharing model between the three tiers of government (footnote. 31), regular transfers from State Finance Commissions (SFC) and the Central Finance Commissions (CFC), tariff enhancements, and improved tax collections. As set out in the sector road map, and being one of the assurances, the MFF also supported measures for improved revenue performance, such as fiscal devolution by GOR, progressive tariff and related collection efficiencies for water and wastewater services, shifting to accrual accounting, and associated structured budgeting."

1,"Lesson: Careful financial management of multicurrency projects. Funding and disbursements for the project were made in several currencies, and this had potential and real negative impacts due to adverse shifts in foreign exchange rates. To mitigate the risks, ADB did not convert cofinancing grant funds it received in the euro and Australian dollar into United States dollars. Instead, by twice reallocating the originally assigned use of grant proceeds between the contracts, funding in each currency was disbursed as much as possible to make payments required by contracts denominated in the same currency, thus avoiding extra costs or losses due to foreign exchange conversions or fluctuations (footnote 10). This innovative approach to managing and mitigating foreign exchange risks in projects funded in more than one currency is considered to be a good practice worthy of adoption in future projects. However, this requires careful management of funds throughout project implementation and prompt reallocation of grant proceeds to avoid payment delays to contractors."
0,"Failure of the Suleimainki Barrage will affect the areas serviced by Pakpattan, Fordwah and Eastern Siddiqui Canals – a combined crop area of 1,532,717 ha (3,787,345 acre).

However, due to emergency measures, some water will be available to the following kharif season crops. In subsequent years, more water will become available until full production is restored within 7 years. The temporal scalars for rabi and kharif crops are given in Table A9.1. However, barrage failure does not mean all crops will be affected as about 50% of the irrigable area uses groundwater. Future crop areas were assumed to be the same as current areas for kharif season (697,957 ha), rabi season (790,480 ha), and perennial and semi-perennial crops such as sugarcane and orchards 44,218 ha).

At project completion in 2013, the impact evaluation report suggested that the project had contributed to increasing project village residents' income by 15%. At the time the project impact evaluation was prepared, the poverty rate data of the project villages overall had not been updated. However, based on the above finding and the overall PNPM program outcomes and outputs and its efficient execution, as well as the follow-up investments in the project area, the project area can be expected to see significant socioeconomic improvement and thus the 2017 target of reducing households living under the poverty line by at least 20% can be met."

The project implementation consulting firm provided 37% of the total inputs (92.9 international and 136.9 national). Individual consultants included a national project coordination consultant to support project implementation and international design specialist for the design and implementation of the Vocational Training Information System (VTIS).23 Training providers implemented programs specified in the human resource development plan, and a firm carried out the social marketing campaign. A separate firm reviewed career guidance as a distinct element of social marketing.

0,"Benchmark financial internal rate of return. The assumed hurdle rate for this reevaluation is the overall real pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for Project 6. The main sources of finance were the ADB loan (approximately 68% of total project costs), which was on-lent to DISCOM-C on a back-to-back basis as a local currency loan with a 100-basis point on- lending margin, and local currency loans from the Power Finance Corporation Limited (from existing lines of credit) and from other domestic sources carrying an average interest rate of 11.5% (approximately 32% of total project costs). There was no equity financing. As shown in Table A14.5, project WACC was re-estimated at 2.0%. 8 The project’s reevaluated FIRRs comfortably exceeds this hurdle rate. The aggregate WACC calculated at appraisal was 6.3%. The lower WACC is primarily a consequence of the fact that at equity contribution of 46% was assumed at appraisal, whereas actual equity contribution was nil.9 On this basis, even though the reevaluated FIRR (for DISCOM-C) is slightly lower than that estimated at appraisal, the project’s actual financial performance is acceptable, and from a financial perspective, the investment was justified because the reevaluated FIRRs still comfortable exceeds the reevaluated hurdle rate. Table A14.5: Re-estimation of Project Weighted Average Cost of Capital 9 Price regulation (such as that used in India's electricity sector) is designed to return efficiently incurred cost to electricity distributors, and to allow them earn an FIRR no less than WACC. Lower equity contribution typically results in lower WACC and therefore lower FIRR (although in the case at hand, the significant loss reduction achieved by the DISCOM-C generates substantial net incremental cash flow, more than offsetting the reduction in regulated revenue arising from the lower equity contribution)."

0,"The civil works for the project included seven contract packages: five for national highways and two for feeder roads. The procurement of civil works contracts began in October 2010 as planned. The procurement process took longer than the DOR anticipated, requiring ministerial level sign-off and formation of a ministerial tender committee with five to six members, including the secretary. The contracts for all seven packages were signed between July and November 2011; contracts for three packages started in October and November 2011, and the remaining four started in early 2012. The civil works started almost 1 year later than planned, which further delayed the progress of civil works during implementation. All contracts required the works to be completed within 32 months, regardless of contract value, location, and geotechnical and topographical conditions. This time schedule was not achievable."
0,"Similarly, without project, Barrage failure and frequent flooding occurs, inflicting damages and losses. With project conditions assume elimination of these losses, the primary benefit being continuation of current crop areas and yields without disruption. In this analysis, the benefits in case of Barrage are dependent upon the year of its failure, which is unknown. The reevaluation takes probability of various failure scenarios for the quantification of benefits. The Barrage rehabilitation and upgrade will not result in increased agricultural production or productivity, and the primary benefit is elimination of the income foregone associated with a barrage failure."

The combination of free rice distribution (average 123 kg/household) and FFW/CFW earnings ($83 to $110 per year) helped cover the rice consumption needs from 3 to 4 months of the target vulnerable population. The FFW and CFW schemes generated more than 2 million person-days of work. The FFW scheme rehabilitated 210 km of rural roads and 4.6 km of dug canals.

0,"ADB’s overall performance remained satisfactory. ADB supported the project in a challenging, slow, and evolving reforms environment. ADB joined a working group and other development partners to streamline institutional reforms and provide a way forward. ADB facilitated (i) loan cancellation, avoiding commitment charges, (ii) loan currency changes, preventing the declining loan trend, and (iii) additional funding for completing part of the command area works in the Khanewal Division, which could have remained unawarded and incomplete, creating disparity within an area water board. ADB staff regularly reviewed progress, recommended actions, and helped the executing agency to overcome implementation issues. Multiple implementation period extensions were a result of ADB–government consultation during project and country portfolio reviews. Weaknesses in ADB’s performance during project implementation were changes in ADB project officers, affecting consistency in project administration, and inadequate follow-up on the progress of institutional changes. ADB supported the extended delivery of projects in Loan 2300 in addition to subsequent tranches. The modification in consulting services resulted in the utilization of the entire loan amount, which in turn resulted in the preparation of projects worth $1.7 billion against the MFF’s $700 million envelope and created an awareness in the government for project readiness."

During implementation, safety features such as metal beam crash barrier, proper road markings, and sign boards had been incorporated in the design and construction of the project roads, particularly incorporating suggestion from gender consultations held at appraisal. As per the data collected from the local police stations during monitoring surveys, the total road accidents after the project increased by 7%, which implies 22% increase in non-fatal accidents and 41% reduction in fatal accidents. The accidents are significant, which largely reflect negligent driver behavior, violation of traffic rules including over-speeding, lack of enforcement besides mixed traffic conditions and inadequate road safety awareness. This issue may be more pronounced particularly on the roads where number of agricultural vehicles is high. This is a systemic issue in India, which is being addressed by the government in a progressive manner. More efforts are required in driver training, enforcement of traffic rules and road safety awareness to the road users in an effective manner.

0,"The overall performance of the civil works contractor was satisfactory, despite delays with counterpart financing and challenges of the project site conditions. The contractor had adequate capability and experience, with a long record of working on road construction in the country. During implementation, the contractor mobilized required staff and equipment, established a camp to accommodate contractor and consultant staff, set up laboratories and other engineering facilities, provided a medical facility and safety helmets and vests to its workers, and installed road signage during the work as agreed by the local traffic management authority. The contractor worked closely with IPIG and the supervision consultant in identifying and resolving engineering issues, especially frost heave cracks in the road. The quality of civil works was satisfactory, and the supervision consultant confirmed that all standards and specifications were met. With the additional financing and extended implementation schedule, the progress of the civil works was ahead of schedule, with over 95% of the works completed in September 2015. The completed road was handed over to the MOTR in October 2015, which was followed by the 1-year defect notification period. All works and remedial activities were fully completed before October 2016. The contractor was familiar with the awareness practices needed to combat HIV/AIDS and implemented an appropriate program during construction."

Grant funds were disbursed from ADB’s account to an advance account jointly managed by MOH and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Project funds flowed from ADB through the advance account to provincial health departments and national institutes using sub-accounts. Each PIU opened a sub-account and disbursed grant funds from it based on the AOP. The PIUs submitted fund transfer requests for the liquidation and replenishment of their sub-accounts. At project completion, disbursements totaled $9.97 million under the project and $3.73 million under additional financing."

0,"Future monitoring. ADB has thus far provided four loans to expressway development in the country, which is significant. An in-depth analysis might be undertaken to assess and document the project design, formulation, and implementation, as well as its socioeconomic impacts. The experiences and lessons learned can be disseminated to on-going and future projects in the country, as well as to other similar developing countries."
0,"Operation and maintenance costs. The HVDS subproject and the installation of capacitor banks are likely to result in a reduction of operations and maintenance (O&M) cost compared to the without-project scenario (primarily a reduction in distribution transformer failures). Objectively, however, it is difficult to assess the extent to which these costs would reduce. Therefore, the approach adopted at appraisal was followed for this reevaluation – the MP regulatory allowance for O&M costs was adopted (typically 2.5% of capital costs, a figure based on the recommendation and experience of the India’s central regulatory authority). The specific conversion factor for O&M costs was estimated to be approximately 1.0 and therefore no shadow pricing of O&M costs was undertaken. O&M costs were assumed to apply to the completed and commissioned portion of each component, from the year after commissioning."
1,"Future monitoring. All project outputs have been achieved and subprojects are fully operating as planned. However, social safeguard requirements should be monitored until compensation payments are fully disbursed (para 26). The project assets are integrated into the national power transmission system rather than comprising a set of stand-alone investments. The focus of monitoring and evaluation of grid development projects will be on NPT’s overall progress and performance."

0,"Project 1 is rated efficient overall, even though the delayed and increased costs of construction and reduced maintenance will have lessened the financial and economic rates of return. The methodology follows the standard practice of comparing life cycle road agency and user costs under with- and without-project conditions, using net present value at a 12% discount, and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the decision criteria. The analysis used the DOW Highway Development and Management Model.19 The analysis focused on savings in transport costs. Value added from better transport links, which created increased opportunities for agriculture and employment, are not quantified in this analysis but are captured through benefits to generated traffic."
0,"For economic prices of non-incremental and incremental water, the resource cost savings and average incremental economic cost of the water were estimated. The economic non-incremental water price is based on time and cost savings, which included water collection cost, storage costs of water, tanker costs of water and bottled water use. The economic incremental water price is based on the household willingness to pay per m3 of water (previous estimate from 2007 proejct preparation with data updated for domestic inflation). Details are provided for the sub-zone project."
0,"At appraisal, ADB was expected to finance 65.20% of the total project cost; the government 20.06%, and DFID and beneficiaries the remaining 14.74%. DFID reduced its grant from $12 million to $2 million in April 2006 due to the implementation delay and its other commitments, but SDC partially offset this reduction and committed a grant of $5 million in November 2006."
0,"Output 2: Improved CDC along borders and economic corridors: At village level, 2,925 women (or 42%) of the 6,971 village health workers were trained on malaria clinical diagnostic and treatment. The project recruited and trained 721 women (or 56%) of 1,278 people as village health workers in all the target provinces. To improve access to quality primary care services, the project provided annual preventive anthelmintic treatment to 1,600,163 women or 81% of reproductive-aged women, 3,484,469 (87%) preschool-aged children and 344,641 (95%) school-aged children in all targeted provinces. To ensure better and timely control of epidemics, community-based CDC activities were conducted and attended by 2,926 women (44%) of 6,713 participants. The community activities included outreach and village meetings on CDC control and prevention, antenatal care, birth deliveries at the health center, as well as early detection of signs and symptoms of illness, home care of sick children, vaccination, and hygiene and sanitation. The project also established the community reporting system using hotline call 115, so anyone can call for free to inquire detailed information on CDC, report outbreaks and make other inquiries. Case Study 1: Mrs Ben Heng (Volunteer Health Worker), aged 59 years old, lives with her son, daughter in law and grandchildren in Kampong Kol village, Sam Pao Poun commune, Kok Thom district, Kandal province. At home, she prepares food, takes care of grandchild and raises backyard chickens. Apart from her daily work, she has volunteered as a village health worker since 1998. Although the work is voluntary, she enjoys taking on her responsibilities because she gained knowledge and contributed in keeping her family and villagers healthy. Since the project started in 2012, Heng attended health trainings on CDC prevention and control, hygiene and sanitation, preventive anthelmintic treatment and vaccination at least once or twice a year. She then disseminated information and health messages, reported diseases through informal meetings or helped gather villagers to attend health education sessions at the health center. “Now, 100% of pregnant women go for regular health check-ups before and after giving birth and all of them deliver at health center. Almost all of the children in my village have received vaccinations,” said Heng."
