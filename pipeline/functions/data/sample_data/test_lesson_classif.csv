1,"Adequate management information system (MIS) and reporting. MSME project implementation needs to go along with effective and efficient MIS consistent with DMF targets at output and outcome levels. While the project implementation relied on the existing MIS of SIDBI and PFIs that can efficiently track all financial transactions, project specific MIS and reporting was not well established, causing difficulties in properly monitoring progress of project implementation and DMF target indicators, with many data collected ex-post basis. To pursue meaningful sector level impacts, future projects would also need to extend the scope of MIS to include the impacts on the critical supply side issues of the MSME subsectors."
0,"Physical activities envisaged under Projects 1 and 2 were fully achieved, while nonphysical activities were partially achieved as described in paras 14-16.6 Due to delays in the implementation of nonphysical component, the borrower requested ADB to extend the loan closing date for Project 1 up to 31 March 2018.

According to the 2006 VHLSS: (i) about 5% of men have a technical worker certificate compared to 2% for women; (ii) about 5% of men have vocational training compared to 3-4% for women (GSO 2006). While participation in vocational training is low overall, it is even lower for women. The proportion of females ranges from 19% to 24%. Gender disparities also exist in terms of subject and type of vocational training. Women tend to be clustered in"
1,"Future monitoring. Since the project was designed as part of a larger project, the outcomes in the DMF should be monitored and reevaluated after the completion of all sections of the M-4, i.e., Faisalabad–Gojra–Shorkot–Khanewal. At that time, surveys should be conducted by the NHA to measure the impacts of the project."
0,"Institutional strengthening and capacity development. The designed activities, particularly the introduction of performance-based and lease contracts, and monitoring and benchmarking system, were only partially achieved largely for technical and systemic reasons: (i) significant delays in the recruitment of project management consultants (PMCs) who were to develop the package for this assignment, (ii) UCSA’s insufficient capacity on the subject,15 and (iii) significant changes in the WSS institutional and legal framework (para. 16). Although the PMCs developed basic performance benchmarking indicators for piloting in Navoi subprojects under project 1, it was not carried forward because of limited knowledge and experience of UCSA and Navoi vodokanal. However, In 2014, the Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) engaged the institutional development consultants to develop performance benchmarking indicators and public services contracts as part of the institutional strengthening component under the World Bank’s Syrdarya Water Supply Project.16 Together with the MOF and UCSA, the institutional development consultants developed a preliminary set of 33 performance benchmarking indicators based on local and international best industry practice. The MOF incorporated the indicators into annual business plans of vodokanals developed in compliance with the Presidential Resolution No. 306 requirements."

Transport costs have been substantially reduced and agriculture and industrial development has been promoted. The project roads have facilitated access to a variety of social services and more working opportunities for the local population.
0,"ADB has recently assisted the government in preparing a Dili Metropolitan Area Water Supply Master Plan, 2016–2030 under Technical Assistance for Urban Services Improvement Sector Project (December 2017).12 The plan is part of an ongoing dialogue with the government on policy and institutional reforms. This engagement is important, as ADB has expertise and experience in supporting governments across the region and in implementing successful urban water supply institutional and policy reforms and related investment. Based on an agreed road map, there is the opportunity to assist the government in developing a sustainable water system for the residents of Dili."
0,"Failure in establishing a permanent cross border internet connectivity across the four SASEC countries, unused internet bandwidth for commercial purposes, rapid advancement of the technologies in the ICT sector, led to non-realization of any measurable economic benefits due to the project’s major component, SASECRN, as envisaged at appraisal. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the project, if implemented without delays which led to increased costs and reduced benefits, would have been economically viable as envisaged at appraisal.

TA’s administration responsibility was delegated from ADB headquarters to Bangladesh Resident Mission on 1 June 2012. The TA was extended seven times, mainly due to delays: (i) in initiating RTN activities, (ii) caused by the earthquake and political disturbances in Nepal, and (iii) in ensuring regional connectivity in Siliguri and connectivity to Community e-Centers (CECs). The consulting contract had sixteen variations for change of scope, replacement of staff, reallocation of resources, adding resources, and was completed by 31 Dec 2017 with a total cost at $3.03 million. Evaluation of Outputs and Achievement of Outcome: At completion, the RTCs were established with the necessary equipment to connect to regional and village network portals at Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC), Royal University of Bhutan in Bhutan, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) in India, and Kathmandu University in Nepal. The RTN portals were developed in each country making each RTC capable to deliver local content needed by CECs and rural communities. Training and capacity building sessions were undertaken for the developers at the RTCs in the areas of multimedia video course and web applications development. A total of six regional workshops were organized from 2011 to 2016, six national workshops between 2011 and 2014, and thirty- four rural workshops in Bhutan and twenty-four rural workshops in Nepal in 2016. As a result, estimated 220 CEC operators, and 4,500 rural people received training. Several applications were developed at the respective RTCs, including (i) telemedicine (by Kathmandu University); (ii) e-commerce (CDAC); (iii) language localization techniques (CDAC); (iv) e-payments and microfinance (by Kathmandu University); (v) mobile phone interface and text-to-speech (RUB); (vi) visual content library (BCC); (vii) village network management information system (BCC); and (viii) distance learning (DL) courses were developed in English language and translated in respective local languages of the VN communities. DL courses rely on video streaming techniques for higher retention and comprehension. However, the RTCs were not connected to the RN due to incomplete implementation of the latter. Moreover, although a total of 31 English distance learning courses were developed, several courses did not attract users due to the contents not meeting the needs of the targeted users, lack of translation into local languages, lack of updating, which all point to potentially inadequate needs assessment in the beginning, and limited marketing efforts. This has affected sustainability, with the RTC in Bhutan closed in March 2018. The ICT innovation development fund was removed from the scope for efficient utilization of the TA proceeds. Finally, the TA was not successful in coordinating with the implementing agencies of the respective countries to ensure timely completion the overall RTN component. Overall Assessment and Rating: The TA is relevant at both appraisal and completion. The TA’s envisaged impact and outcome were aligned with the SASEC’s and ADB’s regional strategy at both appraisal and completion. The TA is rated less than effective because the outputs were only partially achieved. The TA is rated less than efficient, with the available budget not fully utilized, even over the extended implementation period, for achieving all the project outputs. The TA is rated less than likely sustainable because only a very small portion of the project impact is expected to be sustained beyond completion. For example, no new courses were developed after the TA concluded, nor was the content of old courses updated, leading to significant reduction in enrollments in Nepal, although its RCT is still active, from 602 in 2016 to 75 in 2018 and in Bhutan, whose RTC was closed in early 2018 due to low subscription, from 606 (2016) to 44 (2018). The portals and the RTCs in India and Bangladesh are active and providing technical support, but not to a degree that could contribute to ensuring the sustainability of the CECs. Overall, the TA is rated less than successful.

0,"Overall compliance with the covenants was generally satisfactory. At completion, the status of 115 covenants was as follows: complied (96), complied with delays (8), partly complied (5), not complied (5) and one not yet due. Key partial or non-compliances related to institutional strengthening and operation modernization include (i) IMUs’ establishment, training and support to farmer organizations; (ii) submission of legislation to provincial assembly for the establishment of farmer organizations independent of the PIDA Act, July 1997; (iii) development of a staff rationalization program and personnel procedure for the LBDC; and (iv) provision of offices and vehicles for farmer organizations and IMUs. For farmer organizations to be independent of the PIDA Act, July 1997, the Government of Punjab’s view was that the irrigation system should follow a uniform legislation for farmer organizations in all canal circles under the PIDA and that creating a separate legal framework in the project command area will result in non-uniformity and will cause problems in implementing institutional reforms. For IMUs, the PIDA’s revised rules of 2010 allowed existing PID field offices to assist farmer organizations. ADB agreed with the corrective approach, and the PID and the PIDA supported farmer organizations in place of the IMUs. Training to farmer organizations remained partially delivered and their office facilities are expected to be completed in 2018. PMO staffing was a covenant that remained partly complied with, affecting project performance, especially in the last 3 years."

0,"Rehabilitation increases the canal capacity from about 51.1 m3/s to 70 m3/sec at the head, and from 16 to 31 m3/sec at the tail. Of the incremental inflow of 15 m3/sec at the tail, one third (5 m3/sec) is designated for flushing and two thirds (10 m3/sec) for DMI users after treatment. Currently, the WTC is operating below its designed capacity, as reflected in by the water (Table 4, second panel), due to (i) deteriorated secondary irrigation canals; and (ii) insufficient water treatment capacity along the canal and in Jakarta. However, it is expected that, water treatment capacity will increase by 5 m3/sec in 2023, and by another 5 m3/sec in 2028. WTC Operator will adjust the water inflow accordingly to meet the demand."
1,"Provide technical assistance for capacity development. The government has ceased allowing ODA loans to be used for capacity development. Technical assistance can support (i) upgrading of teacher skills in the use of equipment provided by the project, (ii) upgrading of teachers’ ability to train students in the use of equipment, (iii) project monitoring including gender targets, and (iv) providing equipment management training after project completion. This will maximize the benefits of equipment provision and improve sustainability."

The MOH established the Joint Committee on Human Resources Planning and Management as a first tranche policy commitment and issued several subsequent decisions to strengthen the committee’s functioning.11 The committee serves as a focal point for HHR management and development within the MOH and supports policy development (Appendix 3). The project surpassed its target for postgraduate training in human resources planning and management, with 52 health sector staff enrolled in  postgraduate training  against a target of  36 (Appendix 4). The number of women holding senior positions in the MOH had increased by 20%, from 15 in 2010 to 18 in 2015, against a targeted increase of 10%.12"
1,"Realistic sector and institutional assessments. Implementation of the soft components of infrastructure projects—such as gender equality, safeguards, or capacity building—financed by development organizations in Azerbaijan is often challenging because of the lack of capacity and motivation of the executing agencies. It is important to ensure in-depth assessment of the country and sector context as part of transaction technical assistance to guide the design of the soft components of public utility projects in a well contextualized manner. Weak planning systems; business processes; and technical, administration, and financial capacity of the executing agencies can also put project outcomes at risk. Efficiently tailored technical assistance and closer supervision could have helped mitigate this risk."
1,"Road maintenance. A lack of road maintenance (and maintenance of all infrastructure) has long been a problem in PNG. Institutional progress has been made with the formation of the NRA. However, a more concerted effort by the government, with more support from development partners, is needed. (paras.11, 12, 21, 36)."

0,"The project is efficient in achieving its outcomes and outputs. The ADB PCR mission reevaluated the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project using similar methodology at appraisal and the updated data. The economic benefits were recalculated by comparing the “with-project” and “without-project” cases, including reductions in VOC and savings in passenger travel time costs. The EIRR was higher at completion—18.4% compared to 15.0% at appraisal— mainly because of lower capital cost and higher traffic level.30 Because the recalculated EIRR is above the ADB recommended discount rate of 12% at appraisal, the project is considered to be continuously economic viable. Sensitivity analysis results indicated that the project was economically viable for all scenarios. If a 20% maintenance cost increase were combined with a 20% benefit reduction, the EIRR would still be 15.6% for the whole project (Appendix 13)."
1,"Initial delays. The project closing date was extended by 6 months for various reasons, which could be attributed to (i) the lengthy procedure of making the loan effective and (ii) lengthy procurement from preparation of bidding documents to contract signing. Item (i) was a result of the government’s procedural issues (para. 11), while item (ii) arose from insufficient capacities to handle the entire procurement procedure (para. 15). These issues were already discussed in the MFF’s completion report (footnote 3). It is expected that MOTC–MID and COR will make institutional efforts to share and accumulate knowledge and experience among their staff, which could help them manage externally funded (including ADB-financed) projects more efficiently and effectively."
0,"At appraisal it was estimated that counterpart funding would be $4.4 million or 9.6% of the total costs. Of this, duties and taxes were estimated to account for 69%. Actual counterpart funding was $2.5 million (6.4% of total costs) and taxes accounted for 85% of this; the contingency of $0.9 million was not used. While substantially lower than forecast, the lower level of counterpart funding did not have an adverse effect on the project as most objectives were met. Additionally, the risk of implementation delay was flagged as a project risk, however, the project’s design and execution were resilient enough to prevent cost derailment despite a late project start."
1,"Contract packaging and implementation have also yielded lessons. Construction industry capacity assessment is important before rolling out contract packages. Large packages may not work in similar circumstances. The executing agency and ADB made the right decision in combining the Balloki Barrage contracts into in one large contract and dividing the LBDC contract into three separate contracts. However, distribution system packages were large and appeared unmanageable due to wider geographic spread and canal operational flow constraints. The PID’s divisional staff from Balloki, Okara, Sahiwal, and Khanewal were not part of implementation which made the project implementation and canal operations disjointed. In 2015, the PID operations staff joined the PMUs and the PIUs, which improved progress and oversight, and brought about increased ownership and operational takeover. 29 Japan International Cooperation Agency.

0,"Modality. Given ADB's experience with this program and other policy-based loans in the  Pacific, ADB should consider more closely the option of a stand-alone policy-based grant and  loan modality as opposed to the programmatic approach when financing policy-based programs  in Pacific DMCs (para. 30). In Pacific DMCs, one must take into account: (i) the volatility of politics  and frequent turnover of governments, especially in Melanesia; and (ii) the nascent nature of party  and policy politics."
0,"ADB responded promptly to the government’s request to address the food, fuel, and inputs crisis in 2008. Fact-finding started in late June 2008 and the loan was signed in early October. The financing modality of equal shares if ADF grant and ADF loan was appropriate to the country circumstances, and the design and formulation of the project contained necessary and sufficient interventions to achieve the stated objectives. ADB recruited consultants quickly and responded positively to requests for scope changes to accommodate proposed new activities, such as support for the MAFF seed-production institutions."

1,"	In urban water supply projects that have a significant impact on women, it is essential that the role of women and the potential benefits for them are integrated into the project design through a gender action plan and in the DMF target indicators. Women should be considered as customers, users, and as participants in project activities (as staff and as contractors)."
0,"Further action or follow-up. ADB should follow up with the borrower and executing agency on (i) the performance of the long-term performance-based monitoring contracts; and (ii) socioeconomic impact studies up to the end of the MFF period. ADB should follow up with the DOW, the NRA, and the NRSC on their capacity to continue to achieve outputs and outcomes through to the end of the MFF period."
0,"WESSDP was supported by a capacity building TA with a budget of $600,000 from ADB’s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF–IV). The TA was implemented in 2013–2015 and its timing was well coordinated with the program. The TA’s specific outputs were (i) increasing the capacity of the SME DNC, the project management unit of the German–Armenian Fund, and the PFIs to support women entrepreneurs; and (ii) raising the awareness and technical capabilities of existing or potential women entrepreneurs and business support organizations. The TA was rated successful with all anticipated outputs delivered (Appendix 6). The performance of the consultants was rated excellent."
0,"At appraisal, it was expected that, without the project, cropping intensity of paddy would reduce from about 1.74 in 2008 to 1.65 in 2015 due to irrigation water shortage. In contrast, in the with-project scenario, cropping intensity for paddy would increase from 1.74 to 1.97 over the same period due to deteriorated secondary irrigation canal systems. In actuality, cropping intensity remained stagnant throughout the period. However, in view of the rebound of WTC’s water inflow, it can be expected that, in the project’s absence, the cropping intensity could have been reduced from the 1.70 level. This analysis takes the appraisal analysis assumption that cropping intensity would reduce to 1.53 by 2025 in the without-project scenario. In the with- project scenario, cropping intensity would remain at 1.70, which was the observed during 2016."
1,Future assistance to similar projects should estimate financing charges and contingencies for the implementation period more precisely to avoid earmarking a large amount of funding that is not utilized and must be cancelled.
0,"Main gender-related results of the project. The project supported increased literacy skills, social awareness, and income-generation capacity of disadvantaged men and women. It had a total enrollment of 1.2 million people, including approximately 600,000 women and girls. As of March 2013, 1,103,165 learners had graduated, including 552,828 (50%) women. Of the 16 different types of trades under the project, training courses for 10 trades (or 62.5%) were developed in a gender-responsive manner, i.e., the course design considered women’s needs, interests, and potential for income generation. Of the total women graduates, 260,797 (47%) were engaged in income generation at project completion. In terms of occupation of the graduates, statistics reveal that involvement in tailoring trade increased to 51.54% from 0.22% with more females than males choosing tailoring. The average purchasing capacity of the graduates increased from Tk8,000 to Tk11,000. The project had facilitated increased mobility and social networking of women and girls living in remote areas. The mobility of women had increased in 29 project districts since they started attending literacy and skills training classes. The learning centers had offered women learners life skills and knowledge about their own communities, available resources and agencies, income opportunities, local markets, and service providers. The position of women graduates had been upgraded in their families as they could support economically. Their opinions and decisions were valued by the male members in families in terms of savings, procurement of household items and assets, children’s education, marriage of children, and family planning.

0,"At completion, 60 kilometers (km) of road (km 478–538) along the Bishkek–Torugart road corridor was improved to national Category III road standard with two lanes of carriage, asphalt pavement, and a design speed of 90 km per hour. During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) project completion review (PCR) mission, an economic reevaluation of the project was carried out using a similar methodology as that at the additional financing appraisal, and employing the most recent data. The actual traffic counts collected by the supervision consultant were analyzed and the traffic forecasts updated accordingly. Economic benefits were calculated by comparing the “with-project” and “without-project” cases. In the “without-project” case, it was assumed that the roads would remain in their original state. In the “with-project” case, the roads were improved so that vehicles could drive at faster speeds with lower operating costs and less travel time. The reevaluation calculated the project road’s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and assessed its economic viability."

There is growing private sector participation in the power sector through solar farms connected to the distribution systems and leasing of many sections of the transmission and distribution lines to large private sector consumers. Project outcomes were generally achieved, with some variation in specific physical infrastructure based on ground conditions during construction and with allowance for other ongoing improvements to the distributions system funded by various programs."

The sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the project continued to have an EIRR above the appraisal discount rate (12%) in all nine tested scenarios. In the worst-case sensitivity scenario with a 20% maintenance cost increase combined with a 20% benefit reduction, the EIRR was estimated at 12.8% for the whole project. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the project’s EIRR was more sensitive to changes in benefits. Therefore, more attention should be focused on the road condition, facilitation of traffic demand, promotion of socioeconomic development, and increasing incomes of rural road users. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table A12.3. 8 EIRRs for each road were re-estimated as 12.6% for the Manitar–Raidak, 15.6% for the Panbang–Amshingwoong (Nganglam), 30.2% for the Samdrupcholing–Samrang, and 13.5% for the Tsebar–Mikuri–Durung Ri (feeder road).

December 1994 General Department of Development Investment (GDDI) under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) was established under Decree No. 187/CP, and tasked with, among others, lending to government projects including overseas development assistance re-lending projects, at preferential rates. December 1995 Reporting to the GDDI, the National Investment Assistance Fund  (NIAF) was established under Decision No. 808/QD-TTq to mobilize capital and lending to development priority investment projects in disadvantaged regions as identified by the Government. July 1999	GDDI and NIAF were merged to become the Development Assistance Fund (DAF) by virtue of Decree No. 50/ND-CP. The DAF, a non-profit state financial organization, was tasked to mobilize long and medium-term capital, to receive and to manage the state capital resource for investment and development credit and to implement the government’s investment and development assistance policies that were entrusted to the GDDI and the NIAF. The DAF was specifically tasked to: (a) mobilize long and medium term capital, receive state capital resources (including domestic and foreign capital) to implement the national development investment assistance policies; (b) use the Fund’s capital resource for appropriate and effective purposes; (c) carry out investment lending and debt collection; (d) post-investment interest subsidiaries; (e) extend guarantees to investors who borrow capital for investment; (f) entrust and receive investment capital lending trust; (g) perform other tasks as may be assigned by the Prime Minister.

The project was completed with delays within the approved loan amount. Cropping intensity was found to increase at a faster rate than envisaged at appraisal and early realization of benefits improved the EIRR. A benefit reduction scenario shows a reduction of 41% corresponding to a 12% EIRR. In the case of project 2, the recalculated EIRR is 19.5% against 21% at appraisal.

0,"Total equipment costs for the project were $17.92 million. While a direct accounting of resulting incremental operating and maintenance costs for the HPTI is not available, an estimate may be derived. Generally, maintenance costs on equipment for a relatively efficient business should center around 2-3% of equipment replacement asset value.8 While not a perfect measure, absent other measures it provides a basis to estimate incremental costs associated with the project. Based on this, with $17.92 million in project equipment, at 3% of asset replacement value, total maintenance costs for the project would be approximately $0.5 million annually, or about $30,000 per HPTI. Total revenues and total expenses data are unavailable for the HPTI as a group; however, data is available for Hanoi Medical University (HMU) and HCMC University of Medicine and Pharmacy (UMP). Excluding hospital net cash flows, HMU had 2015 revenues of $12.7 million, expenses of $10.4 million, and net cash flows of $2.3 million.

For UMP, 2015 revenues were $22.8 million, expenses were $19.9 million, and net cash flows were $2.9 million; this is over 90 times project incremental operating and maintenance costs. (Note that both universities rely upon a mix of funding sources with state budget support accounting for about 40% of revenues and tuition, training, and other services making up the rest.) In both cases, there are more than adequate cash flows to support the continued operation of the project. For the other HPTI, the incremental costs account for about 0.6% of the aggregate HPTI operating budget. Again, this represents a small proportion of operating budgets.

In this context, the capital structure of investments impacts on the cash returns that the companies receive. In many price regulated regimes the financing structure directly affects the FIRR because, in general, the intention is to allow the regulated entity to earn its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and no more. Under the MP regulatory regime (which is common across India), Transco and the DISCOMs are allowed to earn a prescribed return on capital (that is, a return on capital is included in the companies’ annual revenue allowance). In general, higher equity means higher FIRR (subject to other constraints)."

The project and the additional financing aligned with the CLV governments’ strategic health sector priority of preventing and controlling communicable diseases and with their mutual agreements to implement APSED and achieve IHR (2005) core capacities to sustain regional health security. The additional financing aligned with the commitment made by GMS political leaders at the 2014 East Asian Summit, i.e., to eliminate malaria in the GMS by 2030. The project aligned with ADB’s Strategy 2020 (footnote 8), Regional Cooperation Strategy (footnote 9), the GMS Health Cooperation Program, and ADB’s country partnership strategies for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. The project design was formulated based on previous experience and extensive consultations, and proved to be appropriate for achieving the intended results. The project was implemented as planned, without major changes in scope. The design and monitoring framework was ambitious, but most indicators were relevant and clearly defined. At its completion, the project remained relevant to the CLV governments’ joint implementation of APSED III16 and ADB’s Strategy 2030 (footnote 8).

This could have been incorporated in the project’s design to ensure overall coordination between the four countries across the three components. However, the PMC was separately recruited by, and attached to, each executing agency, while the TA consultant primarily covered the SASECRTN component. Also, the project did not include oversight and project monitoring activities within India since the country did not receive any funds from ADB.

Financing an  untested and innovative approach clearly resulted in transformational impacts regarding how  urban areas are developed in the country. The key delay at start-up was corrected by starting  work in a subset of one local area where 100% agreement had already been achieved (para. 25).  Another lesson learned in land pooling is that proper sequencing of works can lead to better  outcomes. Initially, roads were finished in the areas under land pooling prior to private building  construction, which led to extensive road damage from movement of heavy vehicles (para. 17)."

There were no major consultant recruitment problems reported for the road maintenance component by NRA. However, the consultant firm engaged to support the NRA with road maintenance, Renardet S.A., was underutilized because of the NRA shortage of funding for actual road maintenance works. This led the consultant to focus more on improving designs and preparing operation and maintenance manuals instead of performing road maintenance supervisions. When the consulting firm’s contract ended, the firm was replaced by individual road maintenance engineers (RMEs). The NRA relocated the RMEs to its PIU in Mt Hagen to assist its PIU supervise and monitor its pro-forma road maintenance contracts implemented using its own resources. For the road improvement component by DOW, the general difficulty of hiring qualified and capable national consultants in PNG, led DOW to recruit international consultants in their stead.

1,"Key lessons derived from the project design, implementation and completion: (i) Successful implementation of infrastructure project requires adequate social  preparation and continued engagement with the local communities. The project  was successful in engaging with local communities and address their immediate  needs with social infrastructure and support services. This helped gain their trust  and buy-in for the project. (ii) Since the MFF will be executed in 10 years, adequate institutional capacity within  the executing and implementing agencies is required. It was premature for a new  state with weak capacity. Other financing options would have been more  appropriate. (iii) Uttarakhand being a special category state, 90% of the central government  external debt fund is passed on to the project as a grant. However, the CERC Tariff  Regulation does not allow its return, interest, and depreciation in the revenue  calculation. While grant funding may benefit end-users due to a lower tariff, it may  not be an appropriate funding model for a revenue-earning agency like PTCUL. (iv) The project DMF had indicated a risk factor in achieving the project outcome  should the hydro projects not be completed on time. However, the risk mitigation  measures were not adequately planned. (v) Core functions of UED are administrative in nature; its priority and focus are mostly  on policy formulation and regulation of energy sector for the state. UED did not  have adequate project management and engineering staff. Hence, for UED, the  role as a project executing agency was conflicting and therefore, it was less  effective. The PMO also could not contribute effectively except as a role of the  secretariat. (vi) The second component of the project on institutional strengthening did not have a  need-based framework for capacity development in the project design stage. For  capacity development, the project could have benefitted from establishing cross- learning processes in project management, technical competency, and social  engineering among PTCUL, UJVNL and UED with other utilities. In the absence of  strong PMO and UED's ownership, the mid-term review of late 2012 also could not  help in developing such cross-learning framework."

0,"The evaluation period was 30 years from 2011. Assets were assumed to have an average economic life of 35 years, and terminal values were ascribed based on remaining regulatory book value at the end of the evaluation period.6 Project assets were depreciated on a straight-line basis in accordance with depreciation rates set by MPERC. Financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) were calculated separately for each of DISCOM-C (20.3%), DISCOM-E (2.6%) and DISCOM-W (2.6%) and the calculations are shown in Tables A14.2, A14.3 and A14.4 respectively.7 The FIRR for DISCOM-C is lower than that calculated at appraisal (37.4%), mainly because the appraisal evaluation considered incremental revenue from increased electricity sales (from non-technical loss reduction) as sustainable, whereas in practice any revenue in excess of the ARR is offset against revenue in future years. Also, at the time of the appraisal evaluation the tariff regulation allowed for DISCOMs to capture all of the value of loss reduction, however subsequent amendments to the tariff regulation meant that the benefit of loss reduction has to be shared with customers [footnote 31]. Conversely, the appraisal evaluation did not include the asset-based incremental revenue arising from the investment. However, 20.3% is considered a very high real rate of return in a regulated environment, reflecting the significant loss reduction achieved under the project. FIRRs for DISCOM-E and DISCOM-W were not calculated at appraisal.

The project design should include necessary advance actions and the PMUs should implement advance actions to minimize start-up delays. The recruitment of consultants, especially LIC, should also start before loan effectiveness. The timely mobilization of relevant consultants based on the actual needs of each subproject, following PMU requests, ensures the timely delivery of their required inputs and outputs."

0,"Methodology at appraisal in 2012 and completion in 2018 remains the same. The revaluation confirms that the overall project investment remains economically viable and ensures elimination of the income foregone associated with a barrage and canal failure. Two scenarios were compared to determine the economic net benefits of the investment program: without-project and with-project. The analysis assumes that without the project the barrage will fail at some stage in the future, thereby resulting in lost agricultural income over the following several years plus incur additional capital and operating costs necessary to provide a temporary structure to restore irrigation supplies. The project will not increase agricultural production or productivity, with the primary benefit being the elimination of the income foregone associated with a barrage failure. However, these benefits are dependent upon the year of failure (due to discounting), which is unknown."

0,"Road construction and maintenance. MPRDC is responsible for construction and maintenance of the state roads on behalf of the state government. In the past 10 years, the total fiscal allocations to MPRDC have increased by an average 20.5% per year. With budgetary allocations, about 80% of the maintenance requirements are being met. The balance is met through OMT contracts awarded to the private sector with toll charges. The roads improved under earlier ADB interventions are in good condition. MPRDC carries out road maintenance by assessing specific technical requirements and awarding divisional maintenance contracts basis for non-toll roads and by OMT contracts for toll roads.28 , 29 MPRDC decides the appropriate contract modality based on a broad assessment of the likelihood of receiving a reasonable premium from bidders. All the improved project roads, except two, are maintained through divisional contracts. Two project roads totaling 87.3 km are amongst 22 roads being maintained by MPRDC through OMT contracts. MPRDC has developed and applies a maintenance mechanism for the roads under OMT with a concession period of 4–10 years. The PCR mission visited one of the two OMT roads and found that a toll plaza was in place to collect tolls from commercial vehicles (private vehicles do not pay tolls); about 20 locally hired staff were working at the plaza in three shifts; and the toll plaza has an office equipped with a computer system, an ambulance, a crane, and other required facilities. The toll level is decided in accordance with the toll policy of the Madhya Pradesh government with an increase of about 5% each year. The concessionaire is responsible for road maintenance, including routine maintenance and overlay for 15% of the road length each year. MPRDC staff inspect the road condition regularly."

The DNSA, the implementing agency, was an active counterpart for ADB during the project, and financial management systems were established in the MPW, the executing agency. During implementation, the capacity of DNSA staff to support the project was at times limited due to staff numbers. The limited support created issues that affected project implementation, including having only one leak detection team (not 3), undertaking procurement (MPW), and providing required counterpart funding (especially for O&M). The MPW, as the executing agency, provided strategic project support, though it was unable to implement the planned reforms, as demonstrated by the non-compliance with the covenants, or fully meet the staff resources requirements.

In 2010 MSMEs accounted for 98.5% of all registered enterprises and contributed 43% of GDP and 42.5% of employment,3 reflecting a doubling of the MSME sector’s contribution to the economy since 1999. The women’s economic potential, however, was not fully realized. While women’s educational achievements in Armenia are on par with men, women’s participation in the economy and estimated earned income was lower. In 2012, the unemployment rate among women was 35% (22% for men), while estimated earned income was $1,724 ($2,557 for men).4 The MSME sector is considered crucial for women as it is a good option for their participation in the economy beside public-sector jobs. However, in 2012, women MSMEs represented only 32% of the registered MSMEs.5 This low ratio was because women often lacked the business skills, knowledge, confidence, and access to networks and credit6 needed to start a business.

Since the proposed investment was a logical next step in the devolution of the Madhya Pradesh power sector, ADB determined that there was a strong rationale for supporting the DISCOMs to improve their physical facilities and streamline the management of their operations as well as operationalize the state’s energy policy.9 Due diligence for preparation of the facility was carried out and indicated that major investments would require 8 years to implement, with a logical sequence of works by each of TRANSCO and the DISCOMs. ADB developed the facility as an MFF to facilitate individual loans to the transmission and distribution companies. To accommodate the sequential requirements, five projects would be prepared over 5 years. This would take into account ongoing and proposed investments from other sources, confirmation of project readiness, progress on institutional reforms, and the physical implementation capacity of each DISCOM. Eventually, the MFF was delivered through six projects developed as individual loans, through periodic financing requests (PFRs).10"

0,"Overall, the project is efficient in achieving its outcomes and outputs. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was recalculated using updated data and a similar approach to that at appraisal.12 The economic benefits were calculated by comparing with-project and without- project cases and included vehicle operating cost savings, travel time savings, and benefits of industrial and agricultural development induced by the project roads. The EIRR at appraisal was 19.9% and the recalculated EIRR is 15.8%. The recalculated EIRR is lower than estimated at appraisal because of higher capital costs and lower-than-projected traffic volumes. The recalculated EIRR remains above the ADB-adopted discount rate at the time of appraisal (12%), indicating that the project continued to be economically viable. The sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the project continued to have an EIRR above the discount rate for all nine tested scenarios. In the worst-case sensitivity scenario with a 20% maintenance cost increase combined with a 20% benefit reduction, the EIRR was estimated at 12.7% for the whole project."

0,"The implementation arrangements were as envisaged at the development of the facility and during the appraisal of projects 1 and 2. Neither were they changed during the implementation of the remaining four projects under the facility. The executing agencies, TRANSCO, the DISCOMs, and the MPPMCL, under the direction of their respective managing directors, had overall responsibility for implementation. A dedicated project management unit (PMU) in each executing agency, led by a senior chief engineer and staffed by experienced technical, project construction management, and administrative staff, provided overall day to day project coordination. To ensure ADB procurement guidelines were consistently and efficiently complied with, the design and procurement of all packages and oversight of the safeguard requirements were guided and facilitated from the existing procurement units within the respective executing agencies under the direction of the chief engineer of TRANSCO. Executive engineers for each distribution circle were placed in charge of project works.25 Due diligence with respect to financial matters was exercised by the chief financial officers of TRANSCO, the DISCOMs, and the MPPMCL. Project progress was documented through the quarterly progress reports submitted to ADB. The project organization of TRANSCO, the DISCOMs, and the MPPMCL were generally similar with some variations on unit head titles.

On the Panbang–Nganglam road, damp sections of pavement and pavement failure were noted during site visits. Although the DOR has installed additional cross-drainage and protection walls, pavement strengthening and rehabilitation works should proceed as soon as practical. Project road sections with slope stability issues along the Panbang–Nganglam and Manitar–Raidak roads should be closely monitored to ensure that the entire roads will remain passable even during the monsoon season. The DOR should continue its regular clearing program in these locations while longer term solutions are investigated. Dust pollution is also a growing concern in some areas, e.g. Samdrupcholing. The ongoing program of blacktopping through settlement areas should be prioritized to manage dust levels. Sections of the Tsebar– Mikuri–During Ri road have already been blacktopped under the Eleventh Five Year Plan, and the remaining sections are planned to be blacktopped under the Twelfth Five Year Plan."

This will allow for the collection of useful information on project benefits."
1,"Cost estimates. The difference between the cost estimate at appraisal and the actual contract price can be largely attributed to the absence of detailed designs. The engineer’s estimate was only available in August 2011 and did not fully factor in costs associated with mobilizing an international contractor to a remote project site. Subsequent exchange rate changes (weakening of the Australian dollar by more than 20% between 2011 and 2018) negatively impacted the international contractor (New Zealand-based) and hindered calculations of overall project costs. Government accounts are in Australian dollars, yet most funding was in US dollars. Project costs were substantially underestimated at appraisal, mainly because the engineer who prepared the estimates failed to take into the remoteness of the project site and did not have sufficient information on underground services. ADB should ensure that the consultant makes every effort to meet the scope of services, complying with the schedule and contractual obligations, while being responsive to the government and financiers. More detailed information was needed on costs prior to the project being ready for tendering."

ADB incorporated gender and development in the WSS subsector in the project design within the poverty and social analysis undertaken for all project regions. To enhance the impact and mitigate the risks to women and children, the PPMU developed and implemented a GAP to promote equal participation of female and male stakeholders. The GAP aimed at increasing women’s representation in all project- related and hygiene promotion activities set out under the Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Program. The project team widely discussed GAP indicators and targets with the beneficiaries during the design phase and adequately reflected them in the DMF. The project benefitted more than 260,000 residents with an average of 50% women, including 26% households headed by women with an average household size of 4.5 persons.

Under the TA, substantial work was carried out in road safety management and PPP scheme in the state, covering substantial data collection and analysis. The proposed and developed working plans and recommendations have effectively improved the capacity of road safety management and private sector participation in road sector development in Madhya Pradesh. As suggested by the TA consultant and with their assistance, a Road Safety Cell (RSC) was created and institutionalized at MPRDC. An accident response system (ARS) has been established and is now fully operationalized, which is integrated with the electronic toll collection system (ETCS) with ambulances at toll booths connected to the system. A broad state highway development plan was developed and potential for PPP projects was assessed. The government appreciated the outputs of the TA, which enabled MPRDC to actively pursue its road safety initiatives including setting up of a statewide ARS. Overall, the TA has contributed substantially to the institutional strengthening of the road safety management and private sector participation in the state. The major lessons learnt from the TA implementation include (i) successful implementation of an institutional development program requires strong commitment and support from government and related implementing agencies; and (ii) close coordination between the consultant’s team and government’s technical staff ensures effective delivery of envisaged outputs.

The professional, permanent and technical CPO added value to project implementation and the quality of project outputs. However, for new similar projects, these implementation arrangements, where a central ministry such as MARD work as the executing agency, is in principle no longer possible in accordance with the new government policy. Instead, provinces will be the executing agencies except in the case of large and nationally important irrigation schemes, MARD can still be a central executing agency. For decentralized projects of similar nature, the implementation arrangements should allow experienced, capable agencies like CPO to provide technical guidance and backstop support, and lead coordination between ADB and provincial implementing or executing agencies, even MARD will no longer have executing agency status."

Therefore, ADB  should emphasize the establishment of an effective monitoring and evaluation system as a  precondition for future lending to BT and closely review the covenants of legal agreements during  review missions. Continuous monitoring of the financial performance of BT and close consultation  with the government authority responsible for tariff methodology and policy should help achieve  ADB's intentions. 49 In 2016, BT has reached (i) the liquidity gap with TJS 1.6 billion (about 2.6% of country's gross domestic product); and (ii) total amount payable of TJS 13.7 billion.

0,"Traffic safety. The improved condition of the project road will enable vehicles to travel at much faster speeds. Both residents and authorities pointed out this might cause an increasing number of road accidents even though road safety facilities have been properly installed. Road safety is becoming an acute issue throughout the country; this has been acknowledged by the government, which is developing a road safety strategy with the assistance of development partners. The project road serves as an international transport corridor, with some overloaded trucks, which may seriously damage the road surface and result in road accidents. Although the government installed and operates weighing stations along the corridor, the efficiency and effectiveness of axle weight control needs to be enhanced. To improve road safety in the Kyrgyz Republic, the government plans to install speed and accident control facilities, enforce traffic laws on speeding and overloaded trucks using a modern computerized surveillance system, and conduct national road safety campaigns."
1,"Material price escalation. The price for some materials, especially cement, steel, and asphalt, was substantially adjusted during implementation. Large-scale price escalation caused the contractors to work at a slower pace. Since the standard contract period for PMGSY works is only 12 months, a provision for price escalation was not included in the contracts. If this is the case in the future, this means that if the works take longer than 12 months to complete, price escalation could potentially become an issue. Measures to mitigate this should be put in place during project preparation."

Women employees in project vodokanals constitute less than 20%. Due to structural reorganization of PPMU and PIUs in 2016, there were changes in the gender composition of PCU staff. At the PCU, there are only three females out of 15 employees which comprise 20% and is not as gender-balanced as it was originally envisaged.

1,"Technical and design changes. As discussed throughout the facility completion report, an overarching issue during program implementation was the delays encountered by Azersu. Despite efforts to prepare advance designs for project readiness, Azersu’s performance was hampered by constant changes in technical assumptions caused by insufficient or inaccurate assessments of local conditions, and the definition of administrative areas. The lack of a comprehensive approach to project formulation, implementation, and monitoring is a direct reflection of Azersu’s overall management and its lack of check and balance to ensure proper due diligence, technical verification, and contract management."

1,"Disbursement review process. The government review process for disbursement documents of ADB-financed contracts was different from other co-financiers, which affected contractor’s cash flow, and caused implementation delays. Under ADB-financed contracts, the VEC submits disbursement documents to the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB) for verification, then VDB forwards them to the MOF, and the MOF submits them to ADB’s Viet Nam Resident Mission. Under other co-financed contracts, the VEC submits disbursement documents to the MOF, and the MOF submits them to respective co-financiers office, and forwards their copy to the State Treasury. If the State Treasury finds any issues, the VEC will address them in the following claim. The government obliges review of disbursement documents by VDB prior to the MOF for ADB-financed contracts. In future projects, it is recommended to apply one harmonized disbursement documents review process for all donor financed contracts to avoid any delays in contracts implementation."

0,"The project is rated unlikely sustainable, as it did not achieve institutional arrangements to ensure sustainability at completion. 46 The service level agreements with the service agencies for O&M of the regional network, including the Siliguri peering, were not followed. Apart from Bhutan, a formal contract to manage and operate CECs was not signed. In Bangladesh, CECs are operated on a private entrepreneurship modality and some of them are struggling to maintain uninterrupted internet and power supply, lacking support from the service agency. Most of the equipment installed in the project has reached the end of its estimated life (5 to 7 years) and requires repairs or replacement. Except in Bhutan, there is no known effort by the government to provide future support to the project. Also, in-country service level agreements between RTCs and the service agencies to ensure internet supply to RTCs were only signed in Bhutan. Further, activities essential for making CEC operations sustainable did not happen in any country. Such activities include updating the content of the distance learning courses; adding courses on village network portals to meet users’ needs; updating the software and hardware for equipment and applications; implementing a business and marketing plan for continued CEC operations; and exchanging data and information between the SASEC countries in relation to e-commerce, e- services, and e-training."

1,"Elite capture of land compensation payments. Current local clan structures and national land acquisition processes encourage maneuvering by clan leaders to maximize compensation payments, which can delay or block project implementation. Models are currently being tested where compensation is paid directly to individual clan members, which may partially remove the disincentives for clan leaders to delay or block project progress.13 This also partially avoids formal recognition of clan leadership structures, which is traditionally fluid. These models were assessed during project preparation but considered to have excessive transaction costs for small projects such as the Fiu River Hydropower. This may be considered for future projects."

Since the EAL financing was a small portion of the total financing needed for the country’s rehabilitation, a monitoring framework could have been set up to facilitate timely information sharing with ADB and other development partners. This could have been done through additional technical assistance to supplement the government’s efforts to implement the DRF. Such assistance would have been particularly valuable as the response program of the government stretched capacity, as reflected in the delay in the rehabilitation of schools and the need to establish the construction implementation unit in the MOE. Despite the relatively high capacity and experience of the government in responding to disasters, the magnitude of the damage caused by the cyclone severely stretched the government’s capacity to respond and disseminate information on the constraints being faced and progress made."

Translating the results of the pilot program into a reform of hospital financing mechanisms required engagement with agencies beyond the individual hospital, such as Viet Nam Social Security, which proved an obstacle. Delays in the completion of policy action 9, concerning the costing of care pathways, was a further factor (para. 16). Despite this, the pilot activities contributed to the MOH’s wider efforts on provider payment reform.

ADB, in consultation with the government and other stakeholders, prepared the project in 2007, when Timor-Leste was recovering from a long period of conflict and internal disruption. The government institutions, particularly those responsible for water resources, had limited capacity. ADB supported the government’s priority to improve household access to water. The project was designed quickly to meet that immediate need and, as such, ADB designed a project that it considered could be implemented in a 29- month period. This was found to be unrealistic once the project was effective, and there was a better understanding of the institutional and operating environment, the capacities of the executing and implementing agencies, the human resources available to support the project, the limited understanding of ADB procedures, and the adequacy of financial resources."

In a DOR investigation in 2017, engineers visited the Panbang–Nganglam road and checked the road design, construction quality, and geotechnical conditions of the project road. The investigating team concluded that: (i) the road damage was mainly caused by overloaded trucks carrying cement from Nganglam to hydropower project sites; (ii) the detailed design did not consider such heavily loaded vehicles transporting cement; (iii) geological conditions cause the pavement to remain wet all year round; and (iv) no construction defects were detected.

Using similar methodology as that at appraisal, two types of economic benefits were captured for the project highways, including (i) savings in vehicle operation cost (VOC), and (ii) savings in passenger travel time costs. The VOC savings were recalculated using the latest unit VOC data provided by MPRDC. The VOC savings per vehicle-km were estimated at ₹1.6 for cars/jeeps/vans, ₹3.6 for bus, ₹0.1 for two wheelers, ₹0.5 for three wheelers, ₹3.1 for light trucks, ₹4.2 for heavy trucks, and ₹2.7 for tractors.

In 1984, the sanctioned flow was increased to 278 m3/s however due to insufficient capacity of the canals and structures, the maximum operational discharge remained at 244 m3/s. During the five-year period (2006-2010), the flows into LBDC were on average 16% less than design flows during Kharif and 38% less during Rabi (footnote 1).2 Since 2010 till 2017, flows have generally improved, and in case of 2016 and 2017 when LBDC was rehabilitated to take the designed discharge, the average yearly flow was increased to about 5,300 MCM which is 8% increase over 2001-10.3 During 2016 and 2017, kharif flows were highest in last 10 years, exceeding by 10% on 10 years average.

0,"This form of regulation has been a significant factor in transforming financial outcomes for the companies, and in particular the DISCOMs. Other than support to the poorest consumers, the tariff setting process has been largely depoliticized, and instead the DISCOMs are financially incentivized to identify and implement efficient network investments. Reducing network losses, historically a near insurmountable challenge for state electricity boards across India, is now incentivized through attractive financial rewards that accrue in addition to the incremental revenue that is earned by simply constructing capital assets. These benefits are also shared with consumers, providing an additional incentive mechanism to address the often pervasive view that electricity theft is a victimless crime."

0,"Project financial accounts were audited, and audit reports with the auditor’s opinion and management letters were submitted to ADB annually—except for fiscal years 2010–2012, for which combined submissions were made in 2013. In 2017, an audit report was submitted covering January–June 2017. Although the financial statements are reported in dong, they are generally reconciled with ADB figures. The reports noted a delay in the PIU’s submission of the annual financial statements, some of which also lacked financial management and cash control procedures. To address this, the PMU conducted training and twice-yearly monitoring with the PIUs. This capacity issue, combined with late issuance of the project’s guidance manual on finance and accounting (including asset management), contributed to the slow disbursement in the early years."
0,"The performance of ADB under project 3 and MFF is rated satisfactory. ADB undertook regular review missions, a disbursement review mission, midterm review mission, and project completion review mission to assess progress and advise on the resolution of outstanding issues. Monitoring, capacity building, and guidance by ADB throughout the project cycle helped define processes, address issues through time-bound actions and targets, and expedite project implementation. However, financial management performance of ADB is rated less than satisfactory, as audit shortcomings were identified and commented upon, but missions were not fielded over the years to resolve these issues (paras. 33 and 34). The IPMU found ADB’s support and advice effective in the resolution of project management issues and safeguard management (para. 31). ADB also provided training and supported exposure visits of IPMU and IPIU personnel to other ADB-supported projects. ADB monitoring ensured adherence to due processes and transparency in procurement, disbursements, and safeguards while upholding integrity and ethical standards."

A roadmap coordination and management unit (RCMU) was established under the Directorate of Water Resources and Irrigation, BAPPENAS (the national planning agency), to ensure overall planning. It facilitated coordination among stakeholders (central, provincial, and district 10 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Preparing the Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management Project. Manila (TA 4381-INO). governments) to finance the IWRM road map. As required under the water law, the MPWH developed the strategic water resources plan (Pola) and its implementation plan (Rencana) for the CRB. 11 The Pola and Rencana development capitalized on the road map and was supported by the TA. The road map was then updated to ensure consistency with the Pola and Rencana and handed over to the CRB water council. The CRB road map was complemented by an atlas; an integrated agenda of investment packages; and an interagency coordination guideline. A media and communication campaign was also carried out to disseminate the road map and raise awareness of subnational agencies. Seventeen community pilot activities involving eleven civil society organizations (CSOs) were supported to increase public participation in IWRM at the grassroots level. The mobilization of financing for the subsequent road map interventions was not achieved as planned. However, inspired by the road map  works, the provincial government developed its own IWRM program in 2014 starting with an upstream restoration program.12"

1,"Institutional strengthening and the operation modernization design were ambitious. This proved to be more challenging at implementation stage. Firstly, the project design was adapted to the institutional structure and legal framework prevalent across other devolved canal command areas. This change brought clarity to the PIDA, the PID, the area water boards and the farmer organizations, and enabled the PIDA to use experience gained from older area water boards and farmer organizations. An example was the adoption of training materials in the LBDC command area prepared by the PIDA and the Japan International Cooperation Agency in an earlier project.29 Secondly, ADB joined a working group in 2008 to streamline institutional reforms in irrigation management and maintained continuous dialogue with the government and key development partners. The recommendations from the working group facilitated the PIDA’s revision of area water board and farmer organizations’ rules and regulations. Thirdly, ADB maintained a follow-up when reforms were on hold in 2008–2009. The slow pace of farmer organizations’ development is a repeat lesson learned by ADB. The reforms experienced and the lessons learned with regard to project scale point to the need for further evaluation of institutional transformation of provincial and system scales. The project implementation arrangements design was complex with multiple implementing units, reporting lines, and advance funds accounts. These were streamlined during implementation. Such changes should have been concluded in the initial stages of the project. Civil works were finalized by design consultants recruited after project approval. Consultant recruitment and detailed engineering design required longer preparatory work for a project of this scale and complexity. Following the lessons learned in the first tranche, ADB and the government selected, sequenced, and prepared subsequent tranches well."

0,"At appraisal benefits were anticipated to increase to their full potential over 10 years with cropped area and yield figures being interpolated in a linear fashion between years 1 and 10 and benefits started to be realized in project Year-6 from increased productivity. Further, with project cropping intensity was projected to continually increase from the then 162.4% to projected 171.8% by 2021 (taking project Year-1 as 2007). Similarly, without project, cropping intensity was assumed to decrease by 1% to reach 161.1%. At project completion, on the contrary, cropping intensity in the LBDC command area has increased from 162.4% in 2006 to 171.5% in 2017. This progressive rate is taken to calculate project benefits after completion of project in 2018 and attain projected cropping intensity of 175% in next five years. This increases net present value of benefit attainment higher than at appraisal. Benefits to crops are anticipated to increase to their full potential within 5 years and to be realized after project completion while benefits of reduced pumping will remain for 30 years analysis period.

0,"In the first 2 years of implementation of projects 1 and 2 (2007–2009), there was a   delay in the reporting of the environmental aspects of the facility as TRANSCO and the DISCOMs were not fully cognizant of ADB’s requirements. These were noted in a review mission in October 2010, which included a major review of safeguard issues. Subsequently,   the DISCOMs recruited environmental consultants to provide updating, overview, and monitoring of the environmental management and monitoring plans. Preparation of quarterly and annual reports on the implementation of environmental management plans and related monitoring reports were submitted to ADB and issues addressed. However, the major turnkey contracts on a design-build basis under these early projects did not do any field works until later in 2008 as it took 12–18 months for the process to be completed (para. 22). Hence, few safeguards aspects were monitored during this period. There was a minor encroachment on a forest area under projects 1 and 3 with TRANSCO and approvals were obtained. There was little impact as it mostly involved the clearing of the existing ROWs, which had overgrown since construction in 1980. No complaints were received from the public regarding the environmental, social, or resettlement aspects of the facility for any of the six projects and there were no reported safety issues.26 The related semi-annual and annual reports were posted on ADB’s website."

0,"At the time of project appraisal poverty levels were reported to be increasing. As most people have land, they would be able to grow sufficient food to meet basic household consumption needs. However, wide discrepancies in the wellbeing of different segments of society were reported, particularly as livelihoods are increasingly linked to the cash economy. According to the 1996 household survey, 37% of the population was living below a poverty line of $350 (K461) per year. Furthermore, 17% of the population was unable to meet the basic food requirement of 2,200 calories per day per adult equivalent. Poor economic performance and rapid population growth led to a sharp increase in the incidence of poverty to 53.8% in 2003.

0,"The tranche 1 total investment plan at approval in 2006 was $281.4 million, comprising $271.1 million for the LBDCIP and $10.3 million for the PIAPPF (Appendix 2). Of this, the ADB loan amount for the LBDCIP was ¥25,637,827,000 ($217.8 million). This increased to nearly $315 million by 2011 because of yen appreciation. As a result, and upon the government’s request, surplus loan proceeds were cancelled from the LBDCIP on 13 June 2011, reducing the loan amount to $258 million.15 By September 2015, the loan amount in dollar equivalent had reduced by about $50 million because of loan currency depreciation. The loan amount became insufficient to complete the project. On 20 July 2015, the government converted unwithdrawn loan currency from yen to dollar to manage currency fluctuation. The government also requested additional financing, which was approved as tranche 4 in December 2015, increasing ADB financing from $208.4 million to $235 million and overall ADB financing to $245 million. The additional financing was included in the country operations business plan, 2015–2017 for approval in 2015.

0,"The performance of the borrower and the executing agencies was satisfactory for both the facility and project 6. However, while the technical aspects of the initial projects were carried out properly, the DISCOMs took some time to get acclimatized to ADB procedures.37 This resulted in the overestimation of local currency costs and insufficient monitoring and reporting of safeguards for the first two projects. However, there were no serious issues as during the first 18 months after the approval of the MFF and of the first two projects, there was little actual field works. This was corrected through interaction with ADB in 2010 before major site works were begun, when an ADB review mission identified that there was a need to strengthen the implementation, monitoring, and reporting of safeguards. This coincided with the MFF administration being assigned to the India Resident Mission. Following this, the DISCOMs submitted safeguards reports to ADB as required. All ICB contracts in project 6, were procured, constructed, and commissioned successfully, within the extended loan completion date and within budget. The outputs achieved were generally as estimated at appraisal and/or preparation of the PFRs and the related loan agreements."

0,"Road safety. Road safety remains a challenge in Bhutan. During project implementation, road safety provisions were provided on the project roads mainly in the form of crash barriers, road markings, and traffic signs. The crash barriers were installed on steep and rocky areas which effectively guide and impede the vehicle from going off the road. Appropriate road signs were erected on bends, zigs, and settlement areas to guide drivers. Road markings using hot-applied thermoplastic materials with glass fiber were provided as centerline and side marking on both sides to guide the traffic, particularly important during foggy conditions and for night driving. Due to low traffic volumes and low vehicle speeds, most accidents on the project roads are not significant. Table A13.4 presents the available road accident statistics on the project roads.4 Road safety is still an important priority for the road construction and management authorities in the country. Proper measures should be implemented, including in road design, construction, and operation. Necessary training and education campaigns should also be conducted among road users and residents.

With respect to project 6, the related ADB loan agreement states that loan closing date shall be 30 June 2014, or such other date as may from time to time be agreed. The Project 6 closing date was extended once at the request of the DISCOMs and endorsed by the government and ADB, from 30 June 2014 to 31 December 2014. This 6- month extension was typical for the project. The design-build basis of ICB procurement packages was one of the reasons for the longer than estimated implementation period. This required the contractors to finalize the preliminary designs through technical optimization to confirm the length of new and upgraded lines and revise the equipment requirements. Only after that, could the various equipment and materials be ordered. The delivery time was, therefore, up to 18 months later than estimated when the facility/project schedules were developed. Delays also resulted from the termination of a number of ICB contracts due to the poor performance of the contractors, mostly due to grabbing multiple contracts beyond their capacity, which necessitated the DISCOMs to complete the remaining works. However, the lack of completion by some contractors did not have any negative impact on the eventual quality of the completed works (outputs) and, in fact, saved on costs as the DISCOMs own forces completed the works.

However, the project implementation experienced initial delays because of delays in recruiting the project supervision consultants (PSC). After the completion of the detailed design, the civil work began with the groundbreaking ceremony on 3 October 2009, a huge event in the country. In November 2009, the ADB project mission found the overall progress of the project was only 3%, about 4 months behind schedule. In May 2011, the ADB mission found the overall progress was only 18%, mainly caused by (i) initial delays in subcontractor and supplier arrangements, (ii) early start of the rainy season and a high amount of rain, (iii) remaining LAR and obstructions on already-acquired right-of-way, and (iv) weak financial capacities of the contractors.

Indirect benefits (such as improving backward linkage effects and improving income and employment effects in the agroindustry sector and non-farm sector of the rural economy) and unquantified benefits (such as improved environment, increased water resource management productivity) were omitted for both the economic analysis at appraisal, and the economic reevaluation at project completion."
1,"It is advisable for ADB to remain actively engaged in the sector as ADB’s presence has helped the PCBs remain focused on providing continuing assistance to the MSME sector and improving the quality of such assistance. Future assistance could be predicated on the government continuing or even accelerating reforms in the financial sector—where warranted, with ADB support. A clear strategy with a road map and defined timelines and with broad-based support (discussed extensively with market players) may be useful in advancing sector reforms.24 Moreover, the reform process needs to be institutionalized with transparent procedures and a clear consultative process. Aside from policy reforms, ADB can meaningfully contribute to good governance and best practices among the PCBs and sub-borrowers. TA that has proven to be of positive value should be continued so as to build capacity, deepen knowledge, and ensure the sustainability of the intervention."

1,The investment program has helped the central and state governments gain more experience and identify capacity gaps and areas for improvement through various project implementation activities. Some of the lessons learned are listed in paras. 54–58 and could be considered for ongoing and future projects in the sector.
1,"Support to strengthen the monitoring and reporting. Despite ADB mission reminders, the project monitoring and reporting was weak for Loan B, however, it was strong for Loan A. As the requirements are similar for both loans, one agency could have taken responsibility for project reporting and monitoring, or agencies could have supported each other to meet the requirements."
0,"Implementation arrangements at the subcentral level varied from those prepared at design. The project established 17 PIUs within the beneficiary universities, while only six PIUs at the hub universities were proposed at appraisal.

The loan-financed scope of the project was completed on 30 September 2012 (although unused grant funds were used for seeds production until 2015)."
0,"At project completion, component 3 accounted for $3.006 million (40% of total project costs). This significant cost increase arose from the delays in the contracting and implementation of civil works. A large part of the additional cost was incurred by the design and supervision consultant contract being extended four times by a total of 29.45 months to (i) provide supervision for the three sub-zone interventions; (ii) design the additional civil works in zone 1 and zone 10, which required a consultant for a study assessment and design work; and (iii) for supervision of the civil works (which were delayed) in zones 1 and 10. The extensions resulted in an increase in the value of the contract from $0.862 million to a final cost of $1.968 million."
1,"Assistance to urban public services (e.g., wastewater treatment, water supply, and heating supply) usually involved many agencies during project planning, design, implementation, and operation. More ownership of and leadership by local governments are vital to ensure a successful project, so good practices will be replicated in Hebei and the rest of the PRC."
0,"Overall, the performance of the borrower and the executing agency is rated satisfactory. Both demonstrated commitment to the success of the program despite time overruns, complex implementation arrangements, design changes, force majeure situation at Khanki Barrage during construction, localized damaged at Suleimanki Barrage, repeat biddings, and slow construction progress. Project approval document was revised to incorporate changes for government approvals. The executing agency implemented the project following ADB’s guidelines on financial management, safeguards, disbursements, procurement, recruitment and contract management. PID consulted ADB for guidance on critical matters and prior approvals where needed. The government closed the loan accounts on time. The executing agency made efforts to ensure that the counterpart funds provided were sufficient and timely. The continuity of financing and implementation arrangements after the loan’s closure demonstrates the government’s resolve to complete the works. The executing agency implemented the financial management system and maintained separate and audited accounts. The preparation of site-specific safeguards plans and effective communication strategy helped in social issues and relations with local communities."
0,The project started in 20 May 2011 and completed on 31 December 2017. The project gender classification was effective gender mainstreaming (EGM). A gender action plan (GAP) was developed at the project design and it was revised at the additional financing processing. The results of the GAP implementation are presented in Table A8.3.
1,"Design and monitoring framework. The baselines and targets included in the project  DMF should have been based on reliable and easily accessible data. The DMF indicators should  have been carefully defined to better align with country's commitments and ADB results  framework while leveraging existing global monitoring tools and platforms such as the Sustainable  Development Goals. At the project level, for instance, traffic and fatalities are better measured by  “density targets” i.e., average daily vehicle-km or average crash rate per 100,000 vehicle-km of  travel."
1,"Obtaining assistance from international and national experts in the field is helpful.

1,"This program built on lessons learned from previous ADB assistance programs in Mongolia. Key lessons from ADB’s engagement in earlier economic crises across Asia and the Pacific on how to contain the impact of poverty highlight the importance of (i) strengthening and implementing social protection systems and welfare programs, and (ii) providing development assistance to expand social protection in countries with limited fiscal space. The experience of this program reinforces this lesson. ADB was able to respond quickly to a major economic deterioration and work with the government to ensure that the necessary fiscal consolidation did not harm the poor."
0,"According to the project administration memorandum dated October 2002, the project envisaged three contract packages of consulting services: (i) project administrative service (PAS); (ii) curriculum development and program implementation; and (iii) program monitoring, MIS, and capacity building. During implementation, the following consultants were engaged: (i) 7 individual consultants for PAS, MIS, financial management, procurement, and coordination; (ii) 5 firms for PAS, overseas training, curriculum development and program implementation, MIS, and financial auditing; (iii) 5 MOPAs; and (iv) 32 NGOs for PLCE implementation."
1,"Covenants. Most loan covenants were related to the implementation of the project and are no longer relevant, except the covenant related to the audit requirement of FY2018. This should be monitored, and the audited project financial account of the fiscal year needs to be submitted to ADB on or before 31 December 2018;"
0,"The ultimate efficiency of a project may be determined if it succeeds in achieving its target outcomes on-time and on-budget. If all three factors are in-line, then it may be concluded that the project was cost effective. For this project, as outlined in the project completion report (PCR), of the 16 indicators (originally 17; one was deleted), 14 were achieved, with 8 exceeding the targets (Table 3). As the outcomes were (i) accomplished at lower costs than planned at appraisal, and (ii) done within the same timeframe as planned (despite a delayed start) the project was cost effective."
0,"Overloading control. Regulations for overloading control need to be further strengthened by using weighing equipment. The DOR should continue dialogue with the Road Safety and Transport Authority (within the Ministry of Information and Communications), which currently monitors truck loads. This is to ensure that independent weighing equipment is used on the project roads. Mobile weighbridges should be used, and overloading penalties should also be enforced. On the Panbang–Nganglam road, the DOR in consultation with Road Safety and Transit Authority, has already agreed to set up a weighbridge to check the loads of heavy vehicles."
1,"Changes to tools and regulations must be accompanied with measures to align local incentives in order to maximize impact. This is clearly demonstrated when comparing improvements in the Seal of Good Local Governance (where a strong fiscal incentive was introduced through the Performance Challenge Fund), which almost doubled between 2015– 2017, compared with improvements in the LGU PFM assessment tool scores (where a similar incentive mechanism did not exist), which rose just 20% in 2013–2016. One implication of this finding is that the impact of reforms to update regulations, manuals, and guidelines for managing public resources could be increased by a supporting incentivize mechanism. Given that low capacity of officials is a commonly identified constraint, an incentive mechanism related to a sustainable capacity development framework for core local PFM officials could help multiply the effect of reforms to PFM tools, guidelines, and regulations."
0,"The project was implemented as conceived. No major change was made to the project  design and implementation arrangements. The project was effective in achieving the intended  outputs and outcomes and has contributed to increased urban income, employment, and land  value, and a rise in citizen satisfaction with the urban environment, municipal services, and quality  of life in 47 pourashavas. Through the performance-based fund allocation, the project has helped  (i) improve holding and non-holding tax assessment and collection, including payment of overdue  receipts of the pourashavas; (ii) improve  urban planning and budgeting; (iii) computerize taxation  and accounting systems; (iv) pay past debts and update the payment of staff salary from revenue  income; (v) reduce dependence on public allocations; (vi) improve urban infrastructure and  services delivery, ensuring a better environment; (vii) improve water supply and sanitation and  waste disposal; and (viii) increase participation of the women and the poor in urban planning and  development. The project was efficient in terms of both implementation process and economic  benefits, as well as environmental safeguards, land acquisition and resettlement, and gender mainstreaming. The project is also likely sustainable with the ongoing reforms to further improve  institutions and taxation which will result in better maintenance of project outputs and outcome."

0,"The reduction of technical losses in the distribution network may cause benefits in two ways: (i) in an energy deficit power system, saved energy causes the energy deficit to be lower than otherwise, allowing for incremental consumption of electricity by consumers (valued at their willingness to pay); or (ii) in an energy surplus system, energy saved in reduced distribution losses would reduce output from the marginal generator (a resource cost saving). Overall, MP was running an energy deficit until about FY2015 but now load shedding has now been eliminated. Current projections indicate that surpluses will continue for the foreseeable future. Over- forecasting of demand growth during the 12th plan period (2012-2017) by CEA and consequential over-investment in base-load thermal generation also supports an expectation of energy and capacity surpluses for the medium term for MP and neighboring states.2 On this basis and for the purposes of this reevaluation it was assumed that peak loss reduction would have resulted in incremental output up to and including FY2014, and thereafter it would have resulted in non- incremental output."
0,"The MFF was being implemented concurrently with several other initiatives to improve the state’s electrical distribution systems. These included four national government programs: the Rajeev Gandhi Scheme for Electrification of Villages, the Jyoti Gram Yojna program for electrification of villages; the Restructured Accelerated Power Development Reform Program, and the ADB-supported Feeder Separation Program;14 as well as programs being implemented by each DISCOM, partly self-funded and partly financed by the Rural Electricity Corporation (REC) and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC). To make the best use of the ADB loan funds, each successive project was specifically designed to fill gaps not covered by the various ongoing schemes. The DISCOMs indicated that the multitranche approach helped them address the sequential and changing priorities in each district, which would not have been possible under a conventional project loan. In projects 1 and 3, implemented by TRANSCO, detailed field surveys of existing and new transmission facilities resulted in the relocation of two new 132/33 kV substations. Generally, however, the distributions systems planned by the DISCOMs conformed to the scope identified in the PFRs and related loan agreements."
0,"The Ministry of Finance was the borrower and the PBL’s executing agency. The MOE, through the SME DNC, was the implementing agency of the PBL component. The CBA through the project management unit of the German–Armenian Fund, and the PFIs were implementing agencies of the FIL component. Under the FIL, seven project agreements were signed with local banks and microfinance institutions. However, ArmeconomBank and ACBA-Credit Agricole Bank withdrew from the program.15 Thus, at the time of project completion, the FIL was being implemented through five PFIs. Each PFI established a project management unit for monitoring and reporting FIL proceeds. A project administration manual was prepared, detailing arrangements for procurement, disbursement, accounting, auditing, and monitoring and evaluation. 13 The external auditor chosen by this bank agreed to issue reasonable assurance opinion in exchange for a significant increase in fees.

In the face of growing global climate change and rising food prices, poor and food insecure households were expected to become more exposed to shocks and stresses in future, leading to depletion of their productive assets, increased indebtedness, and reduced investment in health and education. The activities included under the output were (a) improving the Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring and Evaluation system, and (b) improving institutional coordination at the national and provincial levels supporting food security."
1,"Project conceptualization. ADB selected a sector of strength for itself, and a project with strong government backing and ownership. It purposefully kept the scope of its physical interventions limited to the procurement of signaling, power supply, and telecommunication systems, for which international competitive bidding would add value to Turkmenistan, and where ADB’s technical advice would promote innovation. Given the limited understanding by the government on ADB’s safeguards policies, an explicit consideration on the part of ADB was to scope the project in a manner that would not involve land acquisition and resettlement."
0,"However, this institutional set-up was finalized only in April 2012, when the bilateral agreements between the service agencies were signed. Under the agreements, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), the government-owned telecommunications company and the service agency for India, was to design technical specifications for the interconnection and provide the necessary equipment and facilities to operate and maintain the Network Operation Center (NOC) in Shiliguri through its own funds. The prolonged process in determining the operation and maintenance structure of the major infrastructure to be established through the project, despite the assumption to the contrary in the design and monitoring framework (DMF), severely affected the subsequent implementation, and probably contributed to the major delays. The project’s implementation was outpaced by the rapid advancement in the ICT sector in the region, in terms of both technology and private sector-led arrangements for expanding cross-border internet connections, which resulted in the diminished role of government in the sector. In Bhutan, the executing agency reacted to this shift in the sector by initiating a minor change in project scope (para. 13)."

The 22 subprojects fell into 7 categories, and the GEF component involved many activities. Such complexity was challenging even for an experienced project management office. It was overwhelming for the newly established BPMO. All the implementing agencies and BPMO needed to go through a learning curve regarding ADB policies and guidelines. In addition, the language barrier was an issue for most of the staff, and the initial BPMO staff and manager had not had similar project management experience before. The discrepancy between the complicated design of the project and BMG’s capacity to implement such a complex project was a challenge right from the beginning of project implementation."

Strategic changes in gender relation: Improved women’s research and teaching capacity. Ms. Vi Thi Thanh Thuy (Tay ethnic group) is deputy head of the Nursing Department of Thai Nguyen Medical and pharmaceutical University participated in an international exchange program on modern teaching on nursing (skill-lab teaching method) in 10 days in March 2013 in Burapha University in Chonburi province in Thailand. Returning from the training, Ms. Thuy reported that the training was extremely useful because it helped improve her confidence and capacity in designing, delivering, and ensuring quality control of nursing skill training courses under her department. She estimated that since returning from training, her nursing department has received 35,000 of turns of students coming for lab practice. The students come from the nursing department and other specialties such as general medical doctor, and dentistry doctors. Ms. Thuy feels it could be useful if the exchange program could also cover the contents on small repair and maintenance of the body simulation models. She recommends that the future Health Human resource program/projects should include capacity building for health workers in Telehealth skills. This can be built in pre-service training and/or in-service training programs. This will be particularly useful for improving quality of health care services, especially in remote and disadvantage areas.

1,"ADB should develop and implement procedures to promote better understanding at project inception of ADB’s requirements for safeguards implementation. This could include a mandatory workshop during the inception mission that focuses on project-specific safeguard requirements, and ADB’s expectations as to how these should be met by the executing agency during project implementation. A follow-up workshop should then be held soon after any safeguards monitoring consultants have mobilized to ensure that all parties responsible for safeguards have a common understanding of ADB’s requirements and expectations, and how these are to be met in the project-specific situation. Closer monitoring of compliance with safeguards covenants is needed to ensure that non-compliance with ADB requirements is identified and corrected at an early stage, thereby reducing the likelihood of project delays and the implementing agency’s safeguards compliance costs. These measures have been incorporated into the implementation plan for the new energy project with EDC that has recently been approved (footnote )."

ADB should work closely with the HPG to ensure that it has the resources to further revise the present policy framework and implement additional reforms to improve air quality in the BTH region. ADB should continue to engage the HPG in policy dialogue to address air quality improvement in the long term. A PBL is an excellent vehicle to introduce international good practices, offer policy advice, and justify ADB’s value beyond project financing."

In early 2000, South Asia was lagging far behind other parts of Asia in making full use of ICT for their economic and social development.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB), under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program covering Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal, envisaged that the country-level efforts related to ICT could be more effective if well coordinated on a regional level. The SASEC ICT Working Group (ICTWG), established in 2003, identified three urgent areas for improvement in ICT: (i) cross-border connectivity, (ii) rural access to information, and (iii) human resource capacity. In 2005, the ICTWG developed, with ADB’s assistance, a SASEC ICT development master plan, which laid down the strategy, framework, and priorities for regional cooperation in ICT.2 To address these needs, the SASEC countries agreed, at the third ICTWG meeting in Dhaka in September 2006, to develop the concept of the SASEC information highway, which would deliver and facilitate modern broadband information, communication, and knowledge services within and across borders to governments, businesses, research institutes, and rural and remote communities."

Consultancy services provided a total of 519 person-months including 307 person-months of key experts, and 212 person-months of non-key experts. Due to the extension in the civil works contracts, the consultants’ time-based contract was revised to 374 person-months of key and 705 of non-key experts (Appendix 6, Table A6.5). Civil works were grouped into two contracts, one for rehabilitation and upgradation of Pakpattan Canal and one for Suleimanki Barrage. Contracts were awarded in April 2014 through ICB post qualification basis, using single-stage, two-envelope bidding procedures. The award of both contracts was delayed by 9–12 months. Consultants performance was slow initially in finalizing construction drawings. Works contracts moved slowly as well due to weak construction management, revision, and rationalization of design and methodology, and delayed commencement of the barrage contract. Suleimanki Barrage divide wall failure occurred in March 2016, leading to a work stoppage, undertaking temporary measures, reevaluation of construction methodology and redesign of permanent works."

Despite ADB’s continued engagement, the project was canceled, citing the government’s lack of solar energy knowledge and experience, and its decision to consider smaller pilot projects. The government thereafter partnered with a private company to develop solar power plants of 50–100 MW in six regions, including Samarkand, with total capacity of 1,000 MW (para. 38). This is a major lesson indicating the increasing relevance of private sector financing for solar power plants.

0,"Increased water supply to DMI users. This benefit stream depends on the incremental water supply to DMI users, itself a function of water supply forecasts in the with- and without- project scenarios. Between 2007 and 2010, WTC inflow decreased by 6.5% annually. Although appraisal analysis expected water flow to increase by 11.6% between 2008 and 2016, this has not materialized. In actuality, there is no significant increase in water inflow to WTC after the project, which increased by 1.6% between 2008 and 2015. The WTC is operating below its designed capacity due to factors that limit raw water demand: (i) deteriorated secondary irrigation canals; and (ii) insufficient water treatment capacity along the canal and in Jakarta. However, it is expected that, water treatment capacity will increase by 5 m3/sec in 2023, and by another 5 m3/sec in 2028. WTC Operator will increase the water inflow accordingly to meet the demand. This analysis assumes that, without the project, water flow remains at 39.6 m3/sec from 2011, limiting water available to DMI users. In the with-project scenario, the water inflow between 2010 and 2016 are taken from actual data; between 2013 and 2017, water inflow 1 A recent ADB project in Indonesia, Power Generation Sector Project (Loan INO 49203), uses a SERF of 1.15 and a SWRF of 0.90.

The project completion consultation mission was told that the production volume was approximately 4,000 tons in 2017. Before, the project farmers could only carry the oranges on their shoulders and walk via footpaths to nearby markets. With the project road 1,000 trucks transported the oranges to the markets further away, securing a higher price for the produce. It was assumed that at least 50% of the orange production was induced by the project road. Near Dalim, a coal mine opened generating approximately 10–20 trucks per day on the Samdrupcholing–Samrang road transporting coal. Without the project road, transportation of coal was previously impossible. For the Panbang–Nganglam road, it was assumed that there were 1,000 trucks per year transporting oranges with 4 tons per truck, among which about half was due to improved transport conditions. For the Samdrupcholing–Samrang road, there is about 10 trucks per day transporting coal with 20 tons per truck, of which at least 30% was due to the project roads. Such benefits were estimated and included in the project benefits. During review and consultation missions, it was also noted that a substantial number of shops, restaurants, hotels, and garages were opened by the villagers along the project roads to provide services to the drivers, passengers, and vehicles.

1,"Legislative and political risks should be examined carefully. Property tax proposals could not be introduced for 19 thromdes (Thimphu being the one exception) because a Supreme Court writ issued on 15 August 2016 declared the dzongkhag thromdes “unconstitutional” (para. 32). The operationalization of property taxes based on property valuation methodology (PVM) has been delayed even in Thimphu because of its political sensitivity. This demonstrates how policy actions involving legislative changes have to examined carefully for potential political risks and legal issues. Such risks can be particularly acute closer to elections or during a change in government. Contingencies pertaining to such risks should be built into projects during the design stage. For agencies concerned with revenue collection, reforms to improve operational efficiency or expand the tax base may be more acceptable than suggesting higher or additional taxes (Appendix 5, row 1)."

The project supported effective gender mainstreaming with 36 gender actions and seven targets planned. By the MTR, this was revised to 33 actions and six targets.25 Of the 33 gender actions planned, 29 (87.8%) were implemented and 2 were partly achieved. Four (66.7%) of the six targets were achieved, and two were partly achieved. The project also had 14 numerical gender targets (6 GAP and 8 DMF), of which only 6 targets (4 GAP and 2 DMF), or 42.9%, were met. Details on GAP implementation, including issues, recommendations, and achievement of gender targets in DMF gender-related indicators are in Appendix 8."
0,"Repair and improvement of crossing structures. Serious scouring of the Khurul riverbed beneath the arch bridge has created a steep drop making elephant crossing impossible. The deterioration of the Khurul riverbed immediately under the arch bridge will require civil works like filling of rocks and boulders to temper it to a gentler slope allowing elephant movement. Wildlife signs (i.e. droppings and hoof and pug marks) in other oversized culverts also suggest the importance of maintaining and upgrading these structures to maintain habitat connectivity across the road in critical habitat sections. Currently, the design of these culverts (i.e. height of the steps) is not suitable for less limber, larger mammals such as deer and gaurs. The Samrang Bridge in NH-05 may also be a potential underpass for elephants, especially with the increasing human presence in the Neuli underpass. However, the downstream slope at the base of the bridge is being damaged perennially due to torrential flows during monsoon season. Discussions with the DOR indicated that these are beyond the scope of the contractor’s post-construction liability and the agency will provide funding as part of regular road maintenance and other budget sources."
0,"At appraisal, the project was classified as some gender elements (SGM). The resettlement impact on women was assessed as significant. Poor women and women who headed households in the project area were at more risk than men economically (through loss of productive assets due to land acquisition) and socially (through risks posed by HIV, road safety, and possible human trafficking). To address this issue, the resettlement plan included a livelihood program targeted at women in the project districts. The VEC prepared a project-specific gender strategy—described in the summary of the poverty reduction and social strategy—that included capacity-building training and consultation workshops with those affected to increase their understanding of resettlement issues (compensation, entitlements, and grievance procedures) and to develop skills for appropriate livelihood activities."
0,"All subprojects applied a four-step grievance redress mechanism as stated in the resettlement framework and plans. During project implementation, most of the complaints received were related to land ownership verification, errors in the detailed measurement survey process, and missing entitlements.

1,"Lessons from the preparation and implementation of the project are: (i) Care should be taken to endure that research topics are in line with the  government's macro level priorities. As discussed in paragraph 17, the financing  framework study had to be cancelled because the financing responsibility was  moved from the EA to the local government. (ii) Identification of the locations for rural village bus service pilots should be  demand-driven and consistent with the development priorities of county level  governments. As stated in paragraph 15, two pilot sites (Shipai and Xiaowei)  were cancelled because there were already established bus routes within their  areas with committed resources. (iii) Risk management should consider major factors beyond the control of the  executing agency, such as the 4 km road link to the XME that required the  agreement of the Jiangsu provincial government, and thus was outside the  control of the APG (see paragraph 25 and 36). (iv) The traffic forecast should have been more realistic and considered low traffic volume in the initial years of operation. It should have excluded the  uncontrollable factors such as the traffic volume of the 4 km linking section (see  paragraph 36 and paragraph 5 and 6 in Appendix 8)."
0,"The Government of Timor-Leste aimed to improve water supply services for households, businesses, and institutions in Dili, the capital city, by addressing the key underlying causes of the poor service, including (i) a lack of tertiary pipes (reticulation), (ii) the poor condition of tertiary pipes and service connections, and (iii) inadequate demand management.

Also, there is no reduction in NRW losses, or in energy and chemical use that were to generate savings. The water supply service hours were generally significantly less than 24 hours, and variable across the sub-zones. The water quality is poor given the leakage from pipes and infusion and bore well water is untreated. The sub-zone water pressures are generally low as the operating valves were opened to surrounding sub-zones, and the system is not being maintained, with an increase in consumers receiving poor service."

The facility cost breakdown is in Appendix 3 and the project 6 costs are in Appendix 4. The foreign currency of ADB loans were only utilized for the ICB contracts, which included equipment supply and installation on a turnkey basis.21 The summary of the contracts procured by each executing agency for projects 1–5 are in the already completed project completion reports and for project 6 in Appendix 5. TRANSCO and the DISCOMs attribute the unutilized loan funds on the ICB contracts to the fact that unit prices utilized for the ADB-prepared projects 1 and 2 led to higher cost estimates as they did not incorporate (i) more competitive bid prices with ADB financing; (ii) procurement of equipment and materials in India, which led to 20% lower prices; (iii) devaluation of rupee from the time the PFR was prepared and bids were submitted; (iv) Ministry of Finance exemption of the excise duty on ICB contracts under the ADB loan; (v) competitive prices realized from the optimization resulting from field conditions;22 (vi) implementation of remaining parts of terminated contracts from DISCOMs’ own resources;23 (vii) the borrower paying the financing costs; and (viii) works completed by ongoing projects funded from other sources. TRANSCO and the DISCOMs attributed the lower local currency costs to inclusion of installation costs with ICB contracts, which were ADB-financed; lack of import duty and lower tariffs on nationally procured equipment; and works completed by other ongoing projects. The DISCOMs accessed loans from PFC, REC, or from the state to cover their local currency costs."

0,"At the time of preparation of the MFF, an environmental assessment and review framework was prepared. The initial projects 1 and 2—prepared in conjunction with the report and recommendation of the President—as well as the subsequent four projects, were all classified as category B for the environment in accordance with ADB’s Environment Policy (2002). An initial environmental examination (IEE) report, including environmental management and monitoring plans, was prepared and disclosed in Appendix 13 of the report and recommendation of the President for the MFF. IEEs were prepared as part of the PFRs for the subsequent four loan projects and safeguard consultants provided monitoring and prepared the reports to ADB. The construction works included the upgrade and rehabilitation of existing transmission and distribution systems, which were for the main part located along existing road alignments, rights-of-way, and transformer distribution stations. New substations were generally constructed on unoccupied government land, which had been kept available for this purpose. In terms of the transmission works under projects 1 and 3, two new substations were constructed on privately held unoccupied and barren plots, which were not agricultural lands and were procured following local government procedures as per the extant law. The ICB contracts incorporated environmental mitigation to minimize minor construction impacts of temporary road closings and construction of new lines and replacement lines over agricultural lands by completing these during the dry seasons, between crop cycles. Safety measures were incorporated for workers and for the general public by the installation of danger signage on power poles with high voltage (11 and 33 kV) lines. The requirements of the environmental assessment and review framework and related IEEs were met."
1,"Implementation issues. This project was under the second MFF to be processed in Pakistan’s transport sector, at a time where ADB was still piloting the use of this modality. The government was also in early stages of understanding MFF implementation procedures. The MFF tranche 1 of $545 million for 218 km of new alignment and/or greenfield projects, including 34 km in an area plagued by terrorism was ambitious in design, as securing project readiness in 1 year between loan negotiation and loan signing was improbable. This was modified through a reduction in scope, taking a pragmatic view of the implementation challenges and hurdles, including security and institutional capacity constraints. Overall, the project output was delivered with some delay. The Gojra–Shorkot–Khanewal section of the M-4 was also subsequently taken up through ADB loans and is likely to be completed within 2018. Thus, the outcome of the project envisaged at appraisal will still be achieved, although outside the MFF envelope. From a project management and contract administration aspect, the (i) provisions of the contract agreement should be implemented strictly to control unapproved subcontracting and (ii) the availability of adequate working capital with the contractor’s project team needs to be ensured by involving the contractor firm’s head offices. The NHA needs to make sure that the contract’s conditions are respected, and the decisions are taken and implemented timely."

The project involved road sector development with special features to incorporate road safety and environment-friendly elements, and facilitated sustainable economic growth. At completion, the project remained fully aligned with the following thrusts of the country strategy partnership for 2013–2017: inclusive growth, environmental sustainability, infrastructure development, and institutional strengthening and capacity development. ADB has been a significant contributor in the development of Madhya Pradesh, being the only multilateral agency for state highway development until this project (para 6). The project was the third intervention of ADB. Given the success and impacts of implemented projects, ADB approved two further loans for road network development in Madhya Pradesh, which underscores the importance and relevance of road sector development in the state.23 By the end of 2016, ADB had provided 157 loans, grants and TA to the transport sector in India for a total of $13.1 billion, accounting for about 32.8% of total assistance to India.24 Overall, the project is closely relevant to the Government of India’s development objectives and plans, as well as ADB’s country partnership strategy and lending policy."

Only HCMC PC can endorse such recommendations and instruct District 9 to implement these recommendations. During the ADB review mission in June-July 2014, a meeting was held between ADB and Vice Chairman of HCMC PC. During this meeting HCMC agreed to comply with ADB policy and the agreed RP and to instruct District 9 on actions to take to comply with agreed RP. HCMC PC sent detailed instructions to District 9 in October 2014. A meeting was held with the resettlement committee of District 9 on 19 November 2014. During this meeting, the list of vulnerable HH and HH who need to receive additional compensation for their structure was finalized. The budget to implement these corrective actions was approximately D2 billion (equivalent to 95,000 USD). In its letter dated 24 February to VEC, ADB indicated that they have no objection to use loan funds in the imprest account to cover this additional payment. All additional payments have been completed."

Accordingly, a design and monitoring framework and a project performance monitoring and evaluation program was designed as part of the project appraisal document. During implementation, the project supervision consultants (PSC) developed the project performance monitoring system (PPMS) with a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the project impacts. The PSC carried out a baseline survey in 2012 and a project completion survey in 2017 on the indicators designed. A final PPMS report was prepared and submitted to ADB in March 2017.1 During the ADB project completion review mission in February 2019, more recent data was collected. Below are the key findings of the socioeconomic impacts of the project."
1,"Access to rural finance is transformative. The project achieved its objective to increase  rural incomes through improved agriculture production by giving loans to poor rural households,  which allowed them to invest in perennial, annual, and livestock production. These loans were  suitable for poor rural farmers because they had lower interest rates and longer tenors than the  loans typically available at commercial banks. They were more in line with the return on  investments that can be achieved from agricultural production systems, and allowed the poor  households to repay them without undue stress. All households that took out loans used the funds  for the purpose intended and repaid the loans. Giving the poor access to finance can enable them  to seize opportunities to increase their incomes and improve their livelihoods."
0,"A further development under the first ADB financed project was the support extended for the modernization of Madhya Pradesh Power Trading Company (TRADECO). TRADECO procured electricity from generators in bulk to be resold to the DISCOMs at the most economic possible costs—meeting the peak demands of each DISCOM with a uniform tariff across the state. TRADECO was restructured in 2012 to become MPPMCL to better manage the purchase of electric power from numerous private sector generators including solar farms, and the leasing of transmission and distribution lines to hundreds of private users, adopting most economic principles. Thus, MPPMCL focuses on providing innovative, efficient and tailored electricity products and services."

0,"Quality Seed Production. This activity supported quality seed production at Toul Samroang Rice Seed Farm and Kbal Koh Vegetable Research Station through the engagement of farmers’ associations and farmers’ groups. In the absence of agreed contracting arrangements for seed production having been prepared at appraisal, the project developed a contract document for endorsement by ADB and used it for the engagement of the selected farmers’ associations and farmers’ groups.16 Through the engagement of 8 farmers’ association (for rice seed), 9 farmers’ groups (for vegetable and other crops seed) and 2 Research Stations (Toul Samroang and Kbal Koh) the project produced 1,350 tons of rice seed and 46.378 tons of vegetable and other crops seed.

1,"The FIL modality has supported implementation of energy conservation and efficiency improvement projects. However, it is recommended to relax the requirement for financial guarantee by local government, and to let CEB shoulder full responsibility in assessing the types of guarantee or collateral needed as the precondition for approving new subprojects in the future, so that the FIL can be fully market oriented. The third-party M&V agency ensured accurate assessment of subprojects’ energy savings and emissions reductions, which enabled accurate calculation of the energy efficiency benefits. The key was to establish an accurate baseline and, from the outset, design a customized M&V system to verify energy savings achieved. It is also important to use the same methodology for pre- and post-project energy saving calculations throughout the second batch. The energy savings and emissions reduction calculation methods and results provided by the third-party M&V agent will be an important basis for interest rebates to sub-borrowers. To enhance emissions reduction incentive for the sub-borrowers in the future FIL, loan covenants should include an interest rebate as a mandatory practice with clearly defined milestones, so that sub-borrowers who achieve emissions targets can benefit from their action in a timely manner. It is also recommended that the PMO and CEB establish a CO2 reduction registry system for the sub-borrowers to link with nationwide carbon trading in the near future."

Infrastructures built under the community-based water supply and sanitation component were handed over to the communities, which established O&M working groups. These mechanisms worked well and were successfully replicated independently. Solid-waste recycling facilities, which require more maintenance cost and more technical skills to operate, should be handed over to the districts, which would be able to allocate their annual budget for major maintenance. For the grant component, replication of CVM pilots is critical for watershed management. The CVM builds on strengthening the communities around the conservation areas to improve their livelihood and to help protect the conservation areas. Sustainability and replication of those successful community-based activities need continuous involvement of local governments and those project components to be mainstreamed into the local government yearly development program."

Therefore, the project is still considered financially viable. 30 The EIRRs were 19.0% for the HCMC–Long Thanh section and 16.0% for the Long Thanh–Dau Giay section. The higher EIRR for the HCMC–Long Thanh section was mainly caused by higher traffic level. Additionally, the FIRR was subject to sensitivity tests.

The independent monitors provided quality external monitoring reports, although sometimes with delays, and the auditor provided quality audit reports on time and in accordance with their terms of reference. The PMISC comprised international and national consultants and supported the CPO in overall project management, including reviewing the DEDs prepared by local consultants and assisting the CPMU, WRU-PMU and PPMUs to address design deficiencies. The PMISC also assisted to prepare bidding and safeguard documents that were acceptable to ADB, and with contract management. A single PMISC for all implementation agencies had the advantage of lower costs and consistent approaches across subprojects for capacity building, procurement and safeguard document quality assurance, and project performance management. However, the PMISC’s contribution to quality control of the civil works and equipment was limited due to its inability to recruit good quality control specialists. This task was accomplished mainly by the CPO and the PPMUs."

1,"General. The PPMS proved to be a very effective and useful tool for monitoring project performance and providing timely and responsive information on the operation. However, the system was not established until 2 years after project start-up, owing to limited awareness of it and low priority for it at the beginning stage. Project design should include a comprehensive PPMS with defined indicators and collection of broader data than the narrow DMF indicators. The PPMS focus should be on how management decision makers are informed, not just how ADB indicators are reported. The resultant management information systems would provide more adequate data for ADB reporting requirements.

1,"To avoid failure in achieving the overambitious gender targets, gender targets should be identified firmly by the result of gender analysis at the design phase. At the implementation phase, the gender awareness and GAP implementation training activities should be provided as soon as possible to ensure all PMU project staff have a clear understanding of GAP implementation. The mid-term review should be taken as the most appropriated chance for gender target adjustment.

0,"The project is rated relevant at both appraisal and completion, as it was an integral part of India’s strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction through the development of roads. The project supported the Government of India’s (i) Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007–2012), which articulated the need for adequate, cost-effective, and high-quality infrastructure as a prerequisite to sustaining growth; and (ii) Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2012–2017), which continued to focus on inclusive growth and encouraged development in agriculture, education, health, and social welfare through government spending. As a result of state government’s focus on infrastructure development, the GDP growth rate for Madhya Pradesh, one of the poorest states in India, was 8.6% in FY2016, higher than the national average of 7.6%. The coverage and condition of the state’s road network was very poor, and so its improvement was a high development priority.

(Table A10.1: GAP Monitoring Table provides details of the achievements). Ms. Horm Romchang and Mr. Chheun Sen live in Thnall Kaeng Village, Spean Thnaut commune, Chi Kraeng district, Siem Reap province. Because of poverty, they decided to migrate to Thailand in search of work, and left their 7 years old daughter with her grandmother. But when they heard from relatives about the additional financing being implemented in their community and the benefits the additional financing was giving, they decided to return home. From the additional financing, Ms. Horm received rice/vegetable seeds and fertilizer, chickens and pig. Previously, her family grew rice but only one time per year and use photosensitive Phka Romdoul variety. However, after receiving non-photosensitive rice seed, Sen Kra Ob variety, from the additional financing, she was able to grow rice twice per year, first Phka Romdoul and then Sen Kra Ob. Previously, the family produced rice just enough for own consumption. But since she grew rice two times and used good quality seed and fertilizer provided by the additional financing, she was able to harvest more and sold the surplus paddy rice at a higher price. She got around 600 KHR per kilo higher price i.e. around 67% higher price than other paddy rice. She saved some harvest to be used as seeds next year. Her family also attended relevant training courses such as Mushroom Production and Famer Technical Congress. They planned to grow Mushroom after harvest of rice crop. to 20,000 KR. Within a year of vegetable production, she saved some 3,200,000 KR (almost $800). With the money from sale of surplus rice and vegetables, Ms. Horm’s family started a small business i.e. production of big water pot/jar. In a month, the family could produce up to 40 jars and sell them within 4 days. This gave them a net profit of 20,000 KR ($5) per jar. Thus, each month the family is making an income of at least $200. They said that it is better than what they were getting in Thailand, a total of around $175. Besides producing jars, they do rice crop and vegetables production, poultry and pigs raising, etc. They can now live with their family and look after their child which is the most important thing for them. They said when they were in Thailand, they missed their daughter very much. They will never return to work in Thailand again. Recently, they bought one brand new motorcycle and one bicycle for their child to go to school. They expressed their willingness and commitment to send their child to higher education, because they themselves wished to study at higher grades but could not do so because of poverty. They expressed their sincere thanks to the additional financing for providing subsidized quality inputs and techniques that helped them to improve their living condition significantly, especially, helped them to return from migration and live with their family. Because of the support, they graduated from ID Poor I to ID Poor II. They wished the additional financing could continue in non-target areas to help other poor households. Ms. Horm said “we both respect each other and value gender equality. My husband sometime helps me in doing household chore, and I sometime help my husband in making jars. We help each other”."
0,"Changes made during detailed engineering design and construction stages to avoid anticipated adverse environmental impacts. Realignment made in NH-02 and FR-01, and revision of the feeder road design to have lined toe drains avoided anticipated impacts identified during the environmental assessment. The realignment of the NH-02 from the original uphill and almost encircling Oyster Lake to downhill avoided the threat of contaminating water quality from surface flow, sedimentation, and siltation.1 Oyster lake is a two-hectare perched aquifer extending above ground, considered the “only one of its kind in Bhutan2”, provides habitat for oysters, watering hole of elephants, and considered as sacred by local residents. In FR-01, the realignment of the initial three kilometers from the Tsebar starting point avoided the previously identified risk of contamination to the water springs of Tsebar and Zordung villages that provided domestic water to 28 houses. This realignment coupled with the construction of a tunnel also avoided the risks of erosion, impacts to stability, and damage to perimeter walls to Tshebar Nangri Chorten along the first saddle towards Dungmin. Savings from the project bidding, defined as the difference between the DOR civil works estimate against contractor bids, allowed the DOR to improve feeder road design and upgrade it to have L-drains and improve the integrity of the road against erosion. It also facilitated the upgrading of the completed road by the dzongkhags that immediately provided bitumen sealing of FR-01.

0,"Resettlement. Resettlement costs were higher than estimated and more time-consuming  than anticipated during preparation. Other than the underestimation of the number of households  to be relocated and rates subject to inflation due to project delays, other reasons for high costs  were outside the control of the project."
0,"Except for minor changes in scope and implementation arrangements of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MOEFr), Ministry of Health (MOH), and Ministry of  Agriculture (MOA) components, the PFR1 project design was not changed much during implementation. While PFR1 and the grant were implemented as formulated during appraisal, the investment program was not rolled out as planned. At completion, the project remained relevant to the government and country partnership program. The government issued a presidential decree in beginning of 2018 to continue the river basin restoration."

The investment program’s intended outcome is improved accessibility and reduced transport costs in the Highlands Region. The intended impact is export-driven economic growth and rural development in the Highlands Region."

Female project staff were actively involved in various training /on- job training / workshops - such as Cash for Work, Seeds and Fertilizer distribution, M&E, financial review and procedures for budget management, research methodology, data entry and database management, etc. Project monitoring of beneficiaries collected and reported sex-disaggregated data; and GAP implementation and reporting responsibility were incorporated into the TORs of specialists. (Table A9.1: GAP Monitoring Table provides details of the achievements)."
0,"For calculating the reduction in pumping cost, the findings of a groundwater model were analyzed wherein the command area was divided in eight hydrologically similar units and application of annual increase was added to the stochastic data.5,6 The model quantifies savings in pumping cost for two reasons. The first cost saving is from additional canal water availability (substitute water) i.e. reduction in pumping equivalent of increased canal supply. The second pumping cost saving is from water table improvements attributed to recharge and pumping reduction. The economic analysis for the project does not consider first benefit of the model as farmers will continue improving agriculture production, using increased canal water and without reducing pumping. As the groundwater will improve through recharge, for simplification, the reduced pumping benefits of model were reduced to half and used in the economic analysis. 5 Flood flows are added to the increase which could be additionally utilized beyond the sanctioned flows. The simulation 50 year’s flow series based on past observed LBDC withdrawals for post Tarbela period (1977-78 to 2010-11)"

By the loan closing date of 30 June 2017, a detail design of water resources development in Greater Cholistan remained in progress ($140 million). Overall, the PIAPPF delivered a variety of services, including multiple studies, detail design, project approval documents preparation, safeguard plans, economic analysis, bidding documents, updating design, and bid evaluation for more than $1.7 billion worth of projects. The PIAPPF supported capacity development for the investment program. Some of the projects are included in ADB’s country operations business plan, 2018– 2020 (footnote 9). Appendix 1 provides the updated design and monitoring framework and compares the anticipated project outputs with the actual results. At appraisal, project 1 did not have a separate design and monitoring framework."
1,"Institutional issues. Delays in project implementation and sustainability concerns were because of (i) complicated government review process for procurement, (ii) a fragmented decision-making mechanism, (iii) reluctance to adjust tariffs because of political resistance, and (iv) poor O&M. Closer engagement of local governments and Vodokanals and Tazalyks in project management should be ensured. Recommendations"

0,"Future monitoring. All assets installed by the project are in service and generally heavily  loaded. These assets are installed under the capacity of a project management unit in  coordination with several line departments. Once these assets are installed, they are handed over  to a grid system operations team, which takes care of the assets and ensures their proper  functionality and effective use. Specific monitoring of the performance of such assets is thus not  considered necessary."
1,"Overall, the performance of the borrowers and the executing agencies is rated satisfactory. The executing agencies provided counterpart staff as required. They, as well as the implementing agencies, PMUs, and provincial implementing partners, performed well in delivering their responsibilities. In each country, a high-level official from MOH was appointed to the project management, which contributed to successful project implementation. The PMUs also effectively 20 DPT3 vaccines is a class of combination vaccines against three infectious diseases in humans: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus. 21 Data source: MOHs of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. used the experience and knowledge of senior personnel who had been involved in previous ADB health projects. The PPMUs showed strong leadership in carrying out activities in their respective provinces, including active participation in cross-border activities. Cambodia’s PMU also benefited from the standard operating procedures in project implementation developed by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The project structure facilitated the integration of CDC into the preventive health program of MOH in each country. The project procurement-related review in the Lao PDR found the use of project funds for the intended purposes to be satisfactory (para. 37)."
1,"Timing of the project performance evaluation report. Though the overall existing compliance and implementation status is satisfactory and ADB could undertake the performance evaluation during the latter part of FY2020, one program cannot be expected to bring revolutionary reforms and it may be more realistic to evaluate performance of the program after the reforms and impact of other programs start to materialize. ADB is currently supporting the government on various reform programs and with project lending that will further strengthen the reforms initiated under the PSERP."
